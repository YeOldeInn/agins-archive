This extra cost is because their frailer bodies must have much more extensive training to raise these stats.<br /><br /></p></td>

This enables the spellcaster to learn the 4 basic spells offered by the college.  A Hero can also study at the college and learn any of the additional spells offered for another 2000 gold coins per spell.  Each of the Spell College files has a list that the spellcaster can use to check off the spells as he learns them.<br /><br /></p></td>

At the start of the quest, the Wizard can pick one set of cards from any of the colleges he knows, including the cards from the new colleges.  The Elf then picks a set of cards from any of the colleges that he knows, and then the Wizard picks three more sets of cards from his remaining colleges.  Each spellcaster can only choose four cards from the chosen set, even if he has learned more than four spells from that college.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p></td>
