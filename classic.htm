Canyon</h2>With the horde of Orcs hot on their heels, the
adventurer's saw the cliffs of Kjells Canyon up ahead.<br>If they could make it
across the bridge, they could cut the ropes suspending it over the canyon<br>and
escape their enemies.<br><br>The rope bridge over Kjells Canyon was the Orc's
first line of defense into their kingdom,<br>and the Chieftain was not about to
let the warriors use it to escape.<br>Pausing in the chase, he called his Shaman
to his side, and together they prepared a surprise...<br><br>Halfway across the
bridge, the adventurers knew that they had escaped.<br>The nearest Orc would not
reach them before they had gained the far side of the canyon.<br>They could cut
the ropes holding up the bridge and be free of their pursuers.<br>Suddenly,
before their eyes, twin fireballs burst on the ropes, burning through them and
collapsing the bridge,<br><i>with them on it!</i><br><br>Do the adventurers fall
into the river that snakes its way through the canyon?<br>Can they hold on to
the pieces of the bridge and climb back to the top?<br>Which side do they end up
on? <br></b><b>Two 10" x 16" full color tile set.</b><br><br>

<h2>The Riddle In The Sands</h2>With a freshening wind filling her sails, the merchant ship <br>Dame Wilhelma cast off from her berth at Falstaff harbor.
<br>Captain Markus and his crew were headed to Port Fustansel,a six day voyage.
<br><b><i>They never arrived.</i> </b><br><br>Following a fortnight of searching by
fellow merchant ships<br>and Imperial fleet vessels, she was officially declared
lost at sea.<br>Speculation ran rife among the local sailors and captains at the
cause of her disappearance. <br>Except for the occasional mild squall, the
weather was excellent during the period of her trip. <br>The Imperial fleet
constantly patrolling the trade routes made piracy very unlikely, if not
impossible.<br>The Dame Wilhelma's captain and crew were esteemed as a seasoned
and skilled crew.<br><i><b>What could have happened to
them?....</b></i><br><br>...Three thousand leagues away, in the Harokin desert,
a pair of proud Bedouins raced<br>each other with their powerful stallions
toward a nearby dune.<br>Reaching the dune's crest, the faster of the two
suddenly reigns in his panting steed. <br>Before his unbelieving eyes is the
sight of a sailing ship aground in the desert sand! <br>His late arriving
companion is equally stunned <br>at the incongruous vision of the ship marooned
in an ocean of sand. <br>Recovering from their initial shock, these two brave sons
of Mohammed <br>dismount from their horses and commit their fate and fortune to
the will of Allah.<br>Drawing sharp scimitars made of fine Damascus steel from
within their robes,<br>the two Bedouins head towards the mysterious Dame
Wilhelma....<br><b>Three 10" x 16" full colored tiles<br><br><table cellpadding="10">

      <center>
Illuminated by flickering torchlight, this undersea harbor has been used for generations<br>
by pirates, slavers, smugglers, partisans, mercenaries, and the<br>
occasional villian who wants to take over the world.<br>
The entrance is secured by a large portcullis that is opened and closed by a powerful handcranked
winch.<br>
Previous owners have encouraged sharks to dwell in the underground harbor by feeding them table scraps<br>
and the occasional unlucky hostage whose ransom fell through!<br><b>A 10" x 16" full colored tile</td>

      </b><center>Deep in the heart of the Dwarven mountain
of Khaldzudun is a place known as the Firecore.<br>It is here that Dwarven craftsmiths produce
the finest armour, weapons, and jewelry in all the land. <br>The furnace is
built around a primal fire that spouts straight from the Earth's core.<br>A
natural spring, rich in unusual minerals, provides ice cold water<br>to temper the
heated steel of the Dwarven craftsmith's creations. <br>Two magical anvils, Hammersong and
Knellstone, dating over a hundred generations,<br>imbue all the Dwarven
creations with enhanced strength and power. <br>Guarding the approach to this
sacred artifact is a pair of statues<br>of the great Dwarven craftsmiths Dursan
and Oriel. <br><b>A 10" x 16" full colored tile<br></td></tr>
