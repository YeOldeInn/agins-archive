<center><b><font size="6">Liches</center></b></font><br><br><br>

Liches are powerful Undead creatures, brought to life by dark spells.  Usually they are Sorcerers or Necromancers who use their magic to preserve their life in an Undead state.  Liches retain their intelligence, unlike other Undead creatures.  They have the ability to think and cast spells like Sorcerers.  Like regular Necromancers, Liches can use any Chaos spells.  <br><br>

Liches are Fearsome Monsters.  They are so horrible looking that they cause terror into all their enemies.  Anytime a Hero starts his turn in the same room as one of these monsters, he must make a 'Fear' roll at the start of his turn.  The Hero rolls 1 red die, and on a roll of 5-6 he has become afraid and must move as
far as possible from the monster, even if it means leaving the room.  The Hero may not make any attack that turn, even against another monster, but can defend.  If a Hero enters a room with a Fearsome Monster during his movement turn, he must make a Fear roll immediately.  The fear only lasts one turn, but the Hero must make a fear roll every turn he is in the same room as a Fearsome Monster.<br><br>

Like Chaos Warlocks, Liches have no set statistics.  They change for each seperate Liche.<br><br><hr></body>
