<center><b><font size="6">SKAVEN</center></b></font>

 <br><br><br>


Skaven are evil mutant ratmen.  They gain their strength from warpstone, a source of strong Chaos Magic.  They are often found in old tunnels, mines and dungeons.  They dig profusely; their burrows running everywhere under the empire.  Skaven are smart, crafty, and sneaky, and often set ingenious traps for the unwary Hero.<br><br>

An individual Skaven is not much of a threat to a Hero.  Unfortunately, Skaven are rarely found alone.  Usually they are found in great mobs and hordes, where they try to overcome the Heroes with sheer numbers.<br><br>

Skaven live together in clans.  There are many clans, and each clan has a special weapon or ability.  Within the clans, there are many different types of Skaven.  If you enjoy purchasing models, there are plenty to choose from in this monster class.<br><br>

My new monster philosophy is as follows:  1) I enjoy playing new types of monsters with new abilities, but 2) I don't want to spend a fortune to play these new monsters.  Because of rule #2, I don't try to collect a different figure for each type of Skaven in each different clan.  Instead, I play Skaven under the philosophy 'they all look alike to me'.  This would be specially true when a Hero is fighting for his life in the low-light conditions of a dungeon.  Therefore I use the same models for each of the different types of Skaven, occasionally using a different color base or a cloth cape tied around one's neck to set it apart.  Of all the different types of Skaven, these are the types I use:<br><br>

<b>SKAVEN</b><br>
This is the regular, average type of Skaven.  While it knows how to use its weapons, it has no special training.<br><br>

This is a Skaven Noble or General.  It has trained since birth in the ways of warfare.  It is just as sneaky and mean as a regular Skaven, plus it is stronger.<br><br>

<b>SPECIAL SKAVEN</b><br><br>
There are several special Skaven that I have used.  These are not common Skaven, and you probably wouldn't want to have the Heroes meet more than one of these per quest.  Once again, I use the regular Skaven models for these figures.  Unless otherwise noted, these special Skaven can be of any of the types listed above.<br><br>

<b>Assasin</b><br>
Assassins are skilled in the arts of silent movement and close combat.  They can carry poisoned blades (see Special Monster Characteristics in our previous issue for a discussion on Poison) or hide in the shadows, waiting for the Heroes to pass so it can strike from behind.<br>

<b>Plague Monk</b><br>
Plague Monks are armed with a Plague Scroll.  The spell on the scroll will give every Hero in the room/corridor a disease (see Special Monster Characteristics in our previous issue for a discussion on Disease-Bearing Monsters).  It takes two turns for the Monk to cast the spell, during which it cannot be attacked or the spell is lost.  After casting the spell, the Plague Scroll will crumble and cannot be used again.  The Monk will attempt to escape from the Heroes.  If it exits the room and gets out of the Heroes'line of sight, it has escaped.  It can then, if you decide, return later with another Plague Scroll.<br>

<br><br>

<b>Plague Censer Bearer</b><br>
Censer Bearers carry a censer, a chain with a smoking ball on the end.  The Plague Censer is a one-shot thrown weapon.  The Game Master chooses the square on the board that the Censer Bearer is aiming for.  Roll three attack dice.  As long as at least one skull is rolled, the censer has scored a hit on this square.  If no skulls are rolled, the censer misfires. If the censer hits, choose three other squares adjacent to the one the censer hit.  All figures in these four squares must roll to see if they have gotten the plague (see Special Monster characteristics in our previous issue for a discussion on Disease-Bearing Monsters) from the censor.  The plague will not go through walls or closed doors.<br>

<br><br>


<b>Warlord</b><br>
A Warlord is a leader of a clan or group of Skaven.  Warlords wear special Chaos tainted armor, giving them 5 defense dice.  They also bear evil rune covered swords, giving them 6 attack dice.  Their Body and Mind points are the same as Skaven Champions.<br>

<b>Skaven Sorcerers</b><br>
Like Chaos Sorcerers, these Skaven Sorcerers have the ability to cast evil Chaos spells.<br>
