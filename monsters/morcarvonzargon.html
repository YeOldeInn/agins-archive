<i>it was known that Morcar von zargon had magical gifts at his birth. on
 the night he was born a demon came to earth and touch the forhead of
 zargon. zargons mother died of fright from this. his father died later
 when he tried to battle the demon. the demon then took the guise of a
 young maid and ran and laid the baby at the door of mentor's study.
 mentor was a kind man. but also very wise. and used magic to learn
 about zargons birth. but mentors heart got the better of him and he
 raised zargon. thinking he could convince him to battle against chaos
 instead of for. mentor was wrong. when zargon grew older he wished to
 know more and more about magic. at first this did not alarm mentor. but
 when zargon wanted to learn dark magics mentor told him he would no
 longer teach him untill he got these foolish ideas out of his head.
 zargon that night crept into mentors study and opened loretome. the
 book was to much for zargon. and blinded him and crippled one leg.
 mentor hearing a noise ran to see zargon. hurt and wounded. mentor took
 pity. but zargon did not want pity. he was enraged that he could not
 use the magics of loretome and the next day. he summoned a demon to
 take him away. the demon took him to the chaos wastes and bound himself
 into zargon. zargon now with the soul of a demon as well as his own
 inside him. had more magic even then mentor. and was soon known through
 the land as the most powerful wizard in the old world. he gained land
 and apointed himself the title of baron, though he does not know wether
 his parents were royalty or not. and then. he tried loretome again and
 went to mentors study and stole the old book. the very fabric of the
 world trembled at this and mentor flew after him when mentor found
 zargon he was peering over the books with several monstrosities around
 him zargon raised his hand at mentor and shot forth a bolt of black
 magic at him witch mentor could barely counter. zargon once again tried
 to cast magic from loretome. and once again loretomes magics atacked
 zargon. this gave mentor the opurtunity to grab loretome and cast
 escape. zargon realised if he could still not use loretome he would
 need help. he gained the service of the witchlord. and apeared to the
 orcs as a new leader. and banded all the orc tribes togethor, he gained
 the help of ogres and beasts of the frozen borderlands. with his new
 armys and the dark gods and there demons on his side. zargon started to
 level the citys of the empire. yet still with all his power. he swears
 one day to hold the power of loretome. the only thing that seems to be
 out of his reach.<br><br>

the demons name is zargon and the morcars is morcar. von means of a part 
of or conected to in german.  the empire in old world are germanic/french
people. so the name morcar von zargon. is morcer(the wizard) von(conected to "of") 
Zargon(the demon) this is taken somewhat out of context. throw it up to morcars 
twisted sense of humor though.<br><br></i>

                                          Interpretation of story by<br>
                                          Carl  "The Scorpion" Heyl<br><br>





<b>Special abilities</b><br>
 Spellcaster -  Zargon can cast any spell in heroquest. chaos earth fire water air elf
 and even the mages of morcar spells if you use them any spell used in
 your game zargon has and can cast any number of times. but still once
 per turn<br><br>


<b>Uses</b><br>
 Zargon is a difucult fight. but in no way does beating zargon end the
 game. zargon is a servant to dark gods. who will continue to try and
 conquer the old world way after zargons death. Zargon ability to cast
 so many spells any number of times is his real danger. if a hero damages
 him he just lets out with a heal spell. so bassicaly zargon must be destroyed
 in one hero partys turn<br><br>
 
<b>Sugested Miniature</b><br>
 Chaos warlock. any cloaked wizard.
