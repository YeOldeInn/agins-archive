<CENTER><I>Working Stiff Productions proudly presents Graphic Artist Ron Shirtz's Large game tile,</I><BR><BR>
<IMG src="thumbs/cove.jpg" alt="Smugglers Cove"> 

<H1>Smuggler's Cove!</H1>

Illuminated by flickering torchlight, this undersea harbor has been used for generations<BR>
by pirates, slavers, smugglers, rebel partisans, mercenaries, and revolutionaries.<BR>
The entrance is secured by a large portcullis that is opened and closed by a powerful handcranked 
winch.<BR>
Previous owners have encouraged sharks to dwell in the underground harbor by feeding them table scraps<BR>
and the occasional unlucky hostage whose ransom fell through!<BR><BR>

A door to the dock can lead to any number of my tiles,<BR>
such as the Cave tile set--- or even Agin's Inn cellar!<BR>
If you need a villain's hideout, or a secret base of operations,<BR>
this is the tile for you!<BR><BR>

The tile costs $6.00 plus $5.50 for shipping and handling.<BR>
Combine several tiles on your order and save on the shipping!<BR>
