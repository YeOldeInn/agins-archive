<center><i>Working Stiff Productions proudly presents Graphic Artist Ron Shirtz's Large game tile,</i><br><br>
<img src="thumbs/cove.jpg" alt="Smugglers Cove">

<h1>Smuggler's Cove!</h1>

Illuminated by flickering torchlight, this undersea harbor has been used for generations<br>
by pirates, slavers, smugglers, rebel partisans, mercenaries, and revolutionaries.<br>
The entrance is secured by a large portcullis that is opened and closed by a powerful handcranked
winch.<br>
Previous owners have encouraged sharks to dwell in the underground harbor by feeding them table scraps<br>
and the occasional unlucky hostage whose ransom fell through!<br><br>

A door to the dock can lead to any number of my tiles,<br>
such as the Cave tile set--- or even Agin's Inn cellar!<br>
If you need a villain's hideout, or a secret base of operations,<br>
this is the tile for you!<br><br>

The tile costs $6.00 plus $5.50 for shipping and handling.<br>
Combine several tiles on your order and save on the shipping!<br>
