<h1>The Smithworks of Khaldzudun!</h1>Deep in the heart of the Dwarven mountain
of Khaldzudun is a place known as the Firecore<br>where Dwarven smiths produce
the finest armour, weapons, and jewelry in all the land. <br>The furnace is
built around a primal fire that spouts straight from the Earth's core.<br>A
natural spring rich in unusual minerals provides ice cold water<br>to temper the
heated steel of the smith's creations. <br>Two magical anvils, Hammersong and
Knellstone, dating over a hundred generations,<br>imbue all the Dwarven
creations with enhanced strength and power. <br>Guarding the approach to this
sacred artifact is a pair of statues<br>of the great Dwarven craftsmiths Dursan
and Oriel. <br><br>The low res gif shown above doesn't do justice to the detail
of the printed piece.<br><br>Each game tile measures 10" x 16", and is printed
on a high quality color printer <br>on heavy 110 lb. index stock.<br><br>They
sell for $6.00 each, plus $5.50 for priority shipping in the U.S. <br>Email Ron
