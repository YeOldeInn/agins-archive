<H1>The Riddle in the Sands</H1>With a freshening wind filling her sails, the
merchant ship <BR>Dame Wilhelma cast off from her berth at Falstaff harbor.
<BR>Captain Markus and his crew were headed to Port Fustansel,a six day voyage.
<BR><B>They never arrived. </B><BR><BR>Following a fortnight of searching by
fellow merchant ships<BR>and Imperial fleet vessels, she was officially declared
lost at sea.<BR>Speculation ran rife among the local sailors and captains at the
cause of her disappearance. <BR>Except for the occasional mild squall, the
weather was excellent during the period of her trip. <BR>The Imperial fleet
constantly patrolling the trade routes made piracy very unlikely, if not
impossible.<BR>The Dame Wilhelma's captain and crew were esteemed as a seasoned
and skilled crew.<BR><I><B>What could have happened to
them?....</B></I><BR><BR>...Three thousand leagues away, in the Harokin desert,
a pair of proud Bedouins raced<BR>each other with their powerful stallions
toward a nearby dune.<BR>Reaching the dune's crest, the faster of the two
suddenly reigns in his panting steed. <BR>Before his unbelieving eyes is the
sight of a sailing ship aground in the desert sand! <BR>His late arriving
companion is equally stunned <BR>at the incongruous vision of the ship marooned
in an ocean of sand. <BR>Recovering from their initial shock, the two brave sons
of Mohammed <BR>dismount from their horses and commit their fate and fortune to
the will of Allah.<BR>Drawing sharp scimitars made of fine Damascus steel from
within their robes,<BR>the two Bedouins head towards the Dame
Wilhelma....<BR><BR><B>The Riddle in the Sands</B> set includes <B>THREE</B>
large <BR>10" x 16" full colored tiles of the ill-fated Dame Wilhelma.<BR>One a
topside view of the ship, the second of the below decks, and the third shows the
hold.<BR>Details include the Captain's room with bed, sea chest, tant, <BR>and
logbook with a ink smeared page of his last entry! <BR>The Crew quarters is
filled with hammocks, keg,<BR>and the remains of a interrupted card
game!<BR><BR>All three tiles are overlaid with a 1" square grid, perfect for
25mm miniatures!<BR><BR>With just a change of narration by the GM, <BR>the ship
can be considered shipwrecked on a mysterious beach, <BR>sending a band of
heroes on new quests and adventures!<BR>It sells for $15.00, plus $5.50 S&amp;H
in the US <BR>(S&amp;H extra outside the US)<BR><BR>Email Ron Shirtz at <A
