<h1>The Riddle in the Sands</h1>With a freshening wind filling her sails, the
merchant ship <br>Dame Wilhelma cast off from her berth at Falstaff harbor.
<br>Captain Markus and his crew were headed to Port Fustansel,a six day voyage.
<br><b>They never arrived. </b><br><br>Following a fortnight of searching by
fellow merchant ships<br>and Imperial fleet vessels, she was officially declared
lost at sea.<br>Speculation ran rife among the local sailors and captains at the
cause of her disappearance. <br>Except for the occasional mild squall, the
weather was excellent during the period of her trip. <br>The Imperial fleet
constantly patrolling the trade routes made piracy very unlikely, if not
impossible.<br>The Dame Wilhelma's captain and crew were esteemed as a seasoned
and skilled crew.<br><i><b>What could have happened to
them?....</b></i><br><br>...Three thousand leagues away, in the Harokin desert,
a pair of proud Bedouins raced<br>each other with their powerful stallions
toward a nearby dune.<br>Reaching the dune's crest, the faster of the two
suddenly reigns in his panting steed. <br>Before his unbelieving eyes is the
sight of a sailing ship aground in the desert sand! <br>His late arriving
companion is equally stunned <br>at the incongruous vision of the ship marooned
in an ocean of sand. <br>Recovering from their initial shock, the two brave sons
of Mohammed <br>dismount from their horses and commit their fate and fortune to
the will of Allah.<br>Drawing sharp scimitars made of fine Damascus steel from
within their robes,<br>the two Bedouins head towards the Dame
Wilhelma....<br><br><b>The Riddle in the Sands</b> set includes <b>THREE</b>
large <br>10" x 16" full colored tiles of the ill-fated Dame Wilhelma.<br>One a
topside view of the ship, the second of the below decks, and the third shows the
hold.<br>Details include the Captain's room with bed, sea chest, tant, <br>and
logbook with a ink smeared page of his last entry! <br>The Crew quarters is
filled with hammocks, keg,<br>and the remains of a interrupted card
game!<br><br>All three tiles are overlaid with a 1" square grid, perfect for
25mm miniatures!<br><br>With just a change of narration by the GM, <br>the ship
can be considered shipwrecked on a mysterious beach, <br>sending a band of
heroes on new quests and adventures!<br>It sells for $15.00, plus $5.50 S&amp;H
in the US <br>(S&amp;H extra outside the US)<br><br>Email Ron Shirtz at <a
