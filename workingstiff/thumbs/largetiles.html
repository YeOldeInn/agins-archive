<CENTER><IMG alt="Palace Garden"
src="/WorkingStiff/Thumbs/Garden.jpg"><BR><br><B>The Palace Garden</B><BR>

<b>The real politics of the Empire are not determined in the throne room or in parliament, <br>
but in the renown Palace garden. Strolling along the manicured trees and perfumed flowers, <br>
with conversation masked by the running water of the fountains, kings, prime ministers, princes, <br>
and war chieftains make treaties and alliances that will influence the course of many kingdoms.<br><br>

The garden has also been the scene of the occasional assassination of royal and elected officials.<br>
It has also served as a discreet meeting place for secret lovers. Here's an opportunity to have your characters<br>
use thier charisma and social skills instead of swordplay and spells!<br>
This beautiful 10" x 16" tile will provide a refreshing change of location for your party of adventurers<br> who are weary of
one too many trips into slimy dungeons and dusty catacombs!<br><i>$6.00</i><br><br>

endless running stream of water hold any healing properties?<BR>Perhaps it is an
illusion to disorient a group of adventurers?<BR>You decide how to use this
stunning 10" x 16" tile for your next Fantasy RPG campaign!<BR><I><B>Note:</B>
