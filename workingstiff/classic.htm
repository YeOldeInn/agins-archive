Canyon</h2>With the horde of Orcs hot on their heels, the 
adventurer's saw the cliffs of Kjells Canyon up ahead.<BR>If they could make it 
across the bridge, they could cut the ropes suspending it over the canyon<BR>and 
escape their enemies.<BR><BR>The rope bridge over Kjells Canyon was the Orc's 
first line of defense into their kingdom,<BR>and the Chieftain was not about to 
let the warriors use it to escape.<BR>Pausing in the chase, he called his Shaman 
to his side, and together they prepared a surprise...<BR><BR>Halfway across the 
bridge, the adventurers knew that they had escaped.<BR>The nearest Orc would not 
reach them before they had gained the far side of the canyon.<BR>They could cut 
the ropes holding up the bridge and be free of their pursuers.<BR>Suddenly, 
before their eyes, twin fireballs burst on the ropes, burning through them and 
collapsing the bridge,<BR><I>with them on it!</I><BR><BR>Do the adventurers fall 
into the river that snakes its way through the canyon?<BR>Can they hold on to 
the pieces of the bridge and climb back to the top?<BR>Which side do they end up 
on? <BR></b><b>Two 10" x 16" full color tile set.</b><BR><BR>

<h2>The Riddle In The Sands</h2>With a freshening wind filling her sails, the merchant ship <BR>Dame Wilhelma cast off from her berth at Falstaff harbor. 
<BR>Captain Markus and his crew were headed to Port Fustansel,a six day voyage. 
<BR><B><i>They never arrived.</i> </B><BR><BR>Following a fortnight of searching by 
fellow merchant ships<BR>and Imperial fleet vessels, she was officially declared 
lost at sea.<BR>Speculation ran rife among the local sailors and captains at the 
cause of her disappearance. <BR>Except for the occasional mild squall, the 
weather was excellent during the period of her trip. <BR>The Imperial fleet 
constantly patrolling the trade routes made piracy very unlikely, if not 
impossible.<BR>The Dame Wilhelma's captain and crew were esteemed as a seasoned 
and skilled crew.<BR><I><B>What could have happened to 
them?....</B></I><BR><BR>...Three thousand leagues away, in the Harokin desert, 
a pair of proud Bedouins raced<BR>each other with their powerful stallions 
toward a nearby dune.<BR>Reaching the dune's crest, the faster of the two 
suddenly reigns in his panting steed. <BR>Before his unbelieving eyes is the 
sight of a sailing ship aground in the desert sand! <BR>His late arriving 
companion is equally stunned <BR>at the incongruous vision of the ship marooned 
in an ocean of sand. <BR>Recovering from their initial shock, these two brave sons 
of Mohammed <BR>dismount from their horses and commit their fate and fortune to 
the will of Allah.<BR>Drawing sharp scimitars made of fine Damascus steel from 
within their robes,<BR>the two Bedouins head towards the mysterious Dame 
Wilhelma....<BR><B>Three 10" x 16" full colored tiles<BR><BR><TABLE cellPadding=10>

      Cove</h2></CENTER>
      <CENTER> 
Illuminated by flickering torchlight, this undersea harbor has been used for generations<BR>
by pirates, slavers, smugglers, partisans, mercenaries, and the<br>
occasional villian who wants to take over the world.<BR>
The entrance is secured by a large portcullis that is opened and closed by a powerful handcranked 
winch.<BR>
Previous owners have encouraged sharks to dwell in the underground harbor by feeding them table scraps<BR>
and the occasional unlucky hostage whose ransom fell through!<BR><b>A 10" x 16" full colored tile</TD>

      of Khaldzudun</h2>
      </b><CENTER>Deep in the heart of the Dwarven mountain 
of Khaldzudun is a place known as the Firecore.<BR>It is here that Dwarven craftsmiths produce 
the finest armour, weapons, and jewelry in all the land. <BR>The furnace is 
built around a primal fire that spouts straight from the Earth's core.<BR>A 
natural spring, rich in unusual minerals, provides ice cold water<BR>to temper the 
heated steel of the Dwarven craftsmith's creations. <BR>Two magical anvils, Hammersong and 
Knellstone, dating over a hundred generations,<BR>imbue all the Dwarven 
creations with enhanced strength and power. <BR>Guarding the approach to this 
sacred artifact is a pair of statues<BR>of the great Dwarven craftsmiths Dursan 
and Oriel. <BR><B>A 10" x 16" full colored tile<br></TD></TR>
