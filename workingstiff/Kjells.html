<H1>Kjells Canyon</H1>

With the horde of Orcs hot on their heels, the
adventurer's saw the cliffs of Kjells Canyon up ahead.<BR>If they could make it
across the bridge, they could cut the ropes suspending it over the canyon<BR>and
escape their enemies.<BR><BR>The rope bridge over Kjells Canyon was the Orc's
first line of defense into their kingdom,<BR>and the Chieftain was not about to
let the warriors use it to escape.<BR>Pausing in the chase, he called his Shaman
to his side, and together they prepared a surprise...<BR><BR>Halfway across the
bridge, the adventurers knew that they had escaped.<BR>The nearest Orc would not
reach them before they had gained the far side of the canyon.<BR>They could cut
the ropes holding up the bridge and be free of their pursuers.<BR>Suddenly,
before their eyes, twin fireballs burst on the ropes, burning through them and
collapsing the bridge,<BR><I>with them on it!</I><BR><BR>Do the adventurers fall
into the river that snakes its way through the canyon?<BR>Can they hold on to
the pieces of the bridge and climb back to the top?<BR>Which side do they end up
on? <BR><BR>The answers to these questions and more await your band of
adventurers when you purchase this two-tile set...<BR><BR>A two 10" x 16" full
color tile set. One has a 70 foot suspension bridge,<BR>the other a collapsed
bridge for adventurers to cling to and climb their way<BR>back to the top!<BR>It
sells for $12.00 plus $5.50 S &amp; H (US)<BR>(S&amp;H extra outside the
US)<BR><BR>Email Ron Shirtz at <A
