<h1>Kjells Canyon</h1>

With the horde of Orcs hot on their heels, the
adventurer's saw the cliffs of Kjells Canyon up ahead.<br>If they could make it
across the bridge, they could cut the ropes suspending it over the canyon<br>and
escape their enemies.<br><br>The rope bridge over Kjells Canyon was the Orc's
first line of defense into their kingdom,<br>and the Chieftain was not about to
let the warriors use it to escape.<br>Pausing in the chase, he called his Shaman
to his side, and together they prepared a surprise...<br><br>Halfway across the
bridge, the adventurers knew that they had escaped.<br>The nearest Orc would not
reach them before they had gained the far side of the canyon.<br>They could cut
the ropes holding up the bridge and be free of their pursuers.<br>Suddenly,
before their eyes, twin fireballs burst on the ropes, burning through them and
collapsing the bridge,<br><i>with them on it!</i><br><br>Do the adventurers fall
into the river that snakes its way through the canyon?<br>Can they hold on to
the pieces of the bridge and climb back to the top?<br>Which side do they end up
on? <br><br>The answers to these questions and more await your band of
adventurers when you purchase this two-tile set...<br><br>A two 10" x 16" full
color tile set. One has a 70 foot suspension bridge,<br>the other a collapsed
bridge for adventurers to cling to and climb their way<br>back to the top!<br>It
sells for $12.00 plus $5.50 S &amp; H (US)<br>(S&amp;H extra outside the
US)<br><br>Email Ron Shirtz at <a
