<center><b><font size="6">DWARF SLAYER</center></b></font>

 <br><br><br>

This was converted from the Warhammer Quest Profession<br><br><br>


Dwarfs are proud, honorable individuals who hold long grudges against anyone or anything who wrongs them.  Conversely, if they make a promise or owe a favor they will do their utmost to fulfil it, even if the price of doing so is terrible.<br><br>

This fierce pride means that Dwarfs cannot bear failure, loss, or tragedy.  If a Dwarf's family is slain, his treasure horde stolen, or if he fails to fulfil an oath or duty, he is likely to be driven over the edge of sanity by an all-consuming guilt.<br><br>

Dwarfs affected in this manner often go into a self-imposed exile, wandering off into the wildest and most dangerous areas of the world to seek solace and redemption through an honorable death in battle.  They seek out and fight the most ferocious and deadly Monsters they can find, believing that only death at the hands of such terrible beasts will redeem them.<br><br>

These Dwarfs are known as Slayers.  They wear no armor, but their bodies are covered in bright tattoos.  Their hair is stiffened with fat and died bright orange, and stands from their heads as huge crests and mohawks.<br><br>

What many other races cannot understand about Slayers is that even though they are looking for death they never fight to loose.  Even in the pits of despair a Slayer remains a proud warrior.  He will fight with a ruthless determination devoid of fear until either he or the Monster is dead.  If the Monster dies the Slayer must seek a bigger, yet more powerful creature and try once more.<br><br><br>

<b>Race:</b><br>
Slayers are always Dwarfs<br><br><br>


<b>Equipment:</b><br><br>

1.  Weapons:  Slayers may only use Axes and Hammers.  Slayers start the game with an artifact, the Rune Battle Axe.  As long as the Slayer rolls one skull when attacking with the Battle Axe, he may add 1 extra wound to the number of skulls rolled.<br><br>

If the Slayer ever loses his Rune Battle Axe, he may go to a Runesmith, who will replace it with another as owned by a level one Slayer.  He will do this for no cost, as the shame of losing his axe is cost enough to the proud Slayer.  If a Slayer loses his axe he must go to the Runesmith to replace it as soon as the current quest is over, and he may not visit the Slayer Shrine during then because he is too ashamed.<br><br>

If the Slayer ever looses all his weapons in battle, and cannot find an Axe or a Hammer, he will continue fighting barehanded, rolling one attack dice as long as he is fighting this way.<br><br>

2.  Armor:  Slayers never wear any armor of any sort, nor do they use shields.<br><br>

3.  Treasure:  The only items that a Slayer may keep and use are Axes, Hammers, and magical items that do not deal with spellcasting (healing potions, scrolls of strength, etc.).  Other items are added to his inventory, and considered liberated from the Monster that was hoarding them.  They are then lost as the Slayer does not care about them.  Slayers carry gold out of the dungeon with them, but tend to loose it above ground.  Any gold beyond this amount is lost during the Slayer's travels.  Where it goes is anyone's guess, the Slayer does not care very much.  A Slayer does not save gold coins between quests.  He starts each quest with 0 gold coins.<br><br>

4.  The Slayer starts questing with three pieces of Dwarf Stonebread with him.  When he eats a piece of Stonebread, he should roll one red die.  He regains up to that many lost Body Points, but may not go beyond his maximum.<br><br><br>


<b>Fighting:</b><br><br>

Slayers never run or retreat.  Slayers always attack the largest monster in a room or hall first, and will not let up on the attack until either he or the monster is killed, even if the other Heroes retreat.<br><br><br>


<b>Training:</b><br><br>

When a Slayer trains he does not train in the Heroes Guild.  Instead he goes to the Slayer Shrine.  Since Slayers do not tend to keep their gold, instead they gain levels with experience.  Slayers should keep a total of the Body Points of slain foes as experience points.  When they have accumulated enough experience they may move up to the next level, but must visit the Slayer Shrine to do so.  Experience points start at zero after moving up a level.<br><br>

<b>Slayer Shrine:</b><br><br>

In between quests, a Slayer may visit the Slayer Shrine to contemplate the awful event that led him to become a Slayer in the first place.  The Slayer piles his gold on the altar (although he may do this after he has bought items from the armory) and begins his meditation.  If the Slayer donates all his gold before making any purchases, he should roll one red die and consult the following table:
<br><br>
<center>


<center>
<table cellpadding="10" border="5">
<tr>
<th>Die Roll</th>

</tr>

<tr>
<td><center>1</center></td>
<td>No one in the shrine is impressed.  They all have much more money, and the Slayer is thrown out of the shrine in disgrace.  He must leave the shrine immediately.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><center>2</center></td>
<td>The other Slayers in the shrine nod sagely at him, acknowledging him as a fellow Slayer.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><center>3-4</center></td>
<td>The other Slayers are impressed, and usher him into the inner chamber of the shrine, into which only the most exalted Slayers are allowed access.  Roll one red die and consult the Inner Chamber Table to see what happens to him there.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><center>5-6</center></td>
<td>The Slayers are very impressed, and usher him into the inner chamber of the shrine, to which only the most exalted Slayers are allowed access.  Roll two red die and consult the Inner Chamber Table twice to see what happens to him there.</td>

<tr>

<td> A Daemonslayer is so taken with the exploits of the Slayer that he offers to paint a particularly impressive tattoo on his arm.  This is a singular honor, and the Slayer leaves feeling even fiercer than usual, ready once more to seek his own death at the hands of a powerful Monster.</td>

<td>A Giantslayer with an amazing orange mohawk which puts your own hairstyle to shame offers to do the same job to your Slayer's hair.  Some time later he emerges with a crest to end all crests, a truly fearsome sight to behold.  During the next quest, any monster attacking the Slayer must first roll a red die.  On a roll of one they are so frightened by the Slayer's appearance that they lose their attack for that turn.<br><br>

Roll another red die.  On a roll of 6 then the violent orange crest of hair is set so hard that its effect is permanent.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><center>3-5</center></td>
<td>The Runesmith is at the shrine, on Slayer business, and agrees to inscribe a rune on your Rune Axe.  Roll a red die and consult the Rune Table to see which rune he inscribes.<br><br>

Runes are cumulative - 2 Runes of Strength will give the Slayer two extra attack dice.  You may put as many runes as you wish onto a weapon.  If a Slayer gets more than one Rune Of Rage he may use each one once per quest.<br><br>

As soon as you have rolled to see what your rune is, roll another red die.  On a roll of 6 the rune is permanent and does not fade at the end of the next quest.  The Rune of Rage may still only be used once per quest, though.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><center>6</center></td>
<td>Killer Blow!  A Slayer in the inner chamber demonstrates the killer blow attack, lethal in combat.  After a few hours practice, the Slayer has mastered the skill to deadly perfection.  To use this skill, a Slayer must announce that he wishes to do so before attacking.  He only rolls half his normal attack dice (round down).  If he rolls at least one skull, he may roll again after the monster rolls its defense dice.  As long as he rolls a skull, he may continue to attack until the monster is killed.  If he fails to roll a skull on an attack, the attack is over.<br><br>

If the Slayer already knows this skill, then the roll 6 is the same as a roll of 1</td>

</center></center></center><b>Runesmith:</b><br><br>
Like regular Dwarfs, Slayers may visit the <a href="../runesmith.html">Runesmith</a> between quests.<br><br><br>

<b>Special Slayer Skills:</b><br><br>

Slayers begin questing knowing the Spot Weakness Skill.<br><br>

<b><font size = 4>Spot Weakness</b></font> <br>
This skill enables a slayer to spot the smallest chink in an opponent's armor.  If a Slayer rolls all skulls on an attack roll, he has made a perfect blow into the Monster's defenses and it is automatically killed.<br><br>

Besides this skill the Slayer may learn these other skills.  Since the Slayer does not keep gold, he may learn these Skills at the Slayer Shrine.  When he visits there, he may use 500 experience points (total of Body Points of slain foes) to learn a new skill.  The Hero then rolls two red dice, and learns the skill corresponding to the number rolled. If the Hero already knows that skill he should roll again.<br><br>

Regular Slayers cannot learn any new skills at the shrine.  A Slayer must have at least advanced to the Trollslayer level to learn a new skill. <br><br>

A Hero can use only one skill can be used per turn. Some can last for more than one turn. If a Hero is using one of these skills, he may not use another skill until the first wears off.<br><br>

2.  <font size="4"><b>Brute Strength</font></b><br><br>

This skill allows the Slayer to attempt to shove a Monster out of the way.  Roll 1 red die and add it to the Slayer's current Body Points.  The Monster then rolls 1 red die and adds this number to its Body Points.  If the Slayer's number is higher, the Monster is pushed back into any of the three squares behind it that are unoccupied (Slayer's choice).  Having pushed his foe back, the Slayer may now make his normal attacks.<br><br><br>


3.  <font size="4"><b>Berserk</b></font><br><br>

 The Slayer rolls 1 red die.  He adds the number of monsters he has killed during the current combat phase to this number.  If he comes up with a 1 he is so mad he attacks any Heroes in adjacent squares.  Each receives 1 Body Point of damage.  After adding in the number of monsters killed, the Slayer must at least have the number below to go into a Berserk rage:<br><br>

<table>
<tr>
<td>Trollslayer</td>
<td> </td>
<td><center>6</center></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Giantslayer</td>
<td> </td>
<td><center>5</center></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Dragonslayer</td>
<td> </td>
<td><center>4</center></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Daemonslayer</td>
<td> </td>
<td><center>3</center></td>
</tr></table>
<br><br>

4.  <font size="4"><b>Reaction Strike</b></font><br><br>

This skill allows the Slayer to make one immediate attack on a single Monster as soon as it is placed on the board next to him.  If there is more than one eligible target you may choose which to attack.  The attack is in addition to your normal attack.  Because this skill is an instinctive reaction to being ambushed, the Slayer cannot make a death blow with this attack.<br><br><br>


5.  <font size="4"><b>Frenzy</font></b><br><br>

 Each turn, before combat, the Slayer may attempt to become frenzied and enter a state of utter rage for one turn.  Roll a red die and consult the following table.  Trollslayers should subtract 1 from the die roll, Dragonslayers may add 1 to the roll, and Daemonslayers 2.<br><br>

<center>
<table cellpadding="10" border="5">
<tr>
<th>Die Roll</th>
<th>Outcome</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><center>0-1</center></td>
<td>The Slayer loses his senses completely.  Instead of attacking a Monster this turn, he attempts to injure himself.  He rolls his normal attack dice and suffers the damage.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><center>2-4</center></td>
<td>Your Slayer fails to work himself into a frenzy, and is left feeling rather grumpy.  With a wistful sigh, he pulls himself together and fights as normal this turn.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><center>5+</center></td>
<td> The Slayer gets two attacks this turn.</td>
</tr></table></center></center><br><br>


6.  <font size="4"><b>Ignore Fear</b></font><br><br>

The Slayer is largely unaffected by Fear and Terror. His ultimate wish is to die fighting a terrible Monster, so he is often quite cheerful about the prospect of fighting such a beast.<br><br>

You Slayer may reroll a Fear die roll this many times:

<table>
<tr>
<td>Trollslayer</td>
<td> </td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Giantslayer</td>
<td> </td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Dragonslayer</td>
<td> </td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Daemonslayer</td>
<td> </td>
<td>4</td>
</tr></table><br><br>


7.  <font size="4"><b>Lessen Blow</b></font><br><br>

 The Slayer has such a high pain threshold that even the hardest blows have less effect on him than on other Warriors.  When using this skill, anytime the Slayer is hit subtract the number indicated on the table below from the number of Wounds caused during that turn.<br>


<table>
<tr>
<td>Trollslayer</td>
<td> </td>
<td>2 Wounds</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Giantslayer</td>
<td> </td>
<td>3 Wounds</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Dragonslayer</td>
<td> </td>
<td>4 Wounds</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Daemonslayer</td>
<td> </td>
<td>5 Wounds</td>
</tr></table><br><br>


8.  <font size="4"><b>Ambidextrous</b></font><br><br>

The Slayer may fight with two single-handed axes or hammers at the same time when using this skill.  While doing so, he may attack twice per turn, once with each weapon.<br><br><br>


9.  <font size="4"><b>Ignore Blow</font></b><br><br>

The Slayer has such a high pain threshold that he simply doesn't feel some blows at all.  When using this skill your Slayer may try to ignore all blows he received during a turn.  He should roll one red die, and must roll at least the number below to ignore the blows:<br>

<table>
<tr>
<td>Trollslayer</td>
<td> </td>
<td>6</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Giantslayer</td>
<td> </td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Dragonslayer</td>
<td> </td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Daemonslayer</td>
<td> </td>
<td>3</td>
</tr></table><br><br>


10.  <font size="4"><b>Mighty Blow</b></font><br><br><br>

This skill allows you to increase the number of attack dice you roll by giving up twice that number of defense dice.  You may give up all your defense dice if wanted. <br><br><br>


11.  <font size="4"><b>Deathsong</b></font><br><br><br>

 This skill allows your Slayer to survive below zero Body Points by drawing on your inner reserves of strength and willpower.  As soon as you lose your last Body Point you begin to sing a fearful, grim battledirge - your Deathsong.  Rather than dying, you remain standing and can continue to fight.  You now have one Body Point.  When you are hit while singing your Deathsong roll 1 red die.  On a roll of 1-4 the blow has its normal effect.  On a roll of 5 or 6 you ignore the attack's effects and remain standing with 1 Body Point.  You continue to sing your Deathsong until all enemies in the room and in line of sight are killed, or you are healed in a normal manner.  You cannot use this skill if you have a healing potion.<br><br><br>


12.  <font size="4"><b>Blood-Fever</b></font><br><br>

This skill allows your Slayer to make a single Blood Fever attack.  Roll your normal attack dice.  If you succeed in killing the monster, you may move 4 additional squares to another monster and make another Blood Fever attack.  If you fail to kill the monster, you may try again by trading one of your defense die for an extra attack; otherwise your attack ends.  Roll all your attack dice on this extra attack.  You may try again on this enemy or another as long as you have defense dice to trade.  If you succeed in killing the monster with this extra attack, you may move 4 squares and attack again.  Your attack continues until you fail to kill an opponent.  You lose the traded defense dice only until your next turn, even if no attacks are made against you before then.
