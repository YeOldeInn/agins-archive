<center><b><font size="6">THE BEASTMASTER</font></b></center>

 <br><br><br>

Converted from 'The Beastmaster', a Warhammer Quest Profession by T. Jordan "Greywolf" Peacock<br><br><br>


There are a group of Elves so closely attuned to nature that they have developed a telepathic bond with animals and have even developed limited shape-shifting abilities.  These Elves are known as Beastmasters.<br><br>

In combat Beastmasters are most unnerving.  They carry no weapons nor do they wear armor, for they need none.  When attacking their bones snap and a hand transforms into a sharp claw or talon.  After a terrible slash, the Beastmaster shifts back once more, leaving no evidence of the unearthly transformation save for the terrible wounds left behind.  When being attacked the suddenly sprout thick fur or feathers which shields their bodies from even the most devastating blows.<br><br>

Unlike most Elves, Beastmasters have given up the pursuit of the Arcane Arts to study the ways of Nature.  They carry no spells into battle, nor do they wish to learn any.<br><br>

When an Elf decides to become a Beastmaster, he chooses a totem, either Bear, Wildcat, or Hawk.  He becomes very closely attuned to that particular animal, and takes on aspects of it.<br><br><br>


<b>Race:</b><br>
Beastmasters are always Elves.<br><br><br>


<b>Equipment:</b><br>

Beastmasters never wear armor nor carry weapons.  They use their shapeshifting abilities to attack and defend.<br><br>

The Beastmaster's arm shifts into beast form when he attacks.  This allows him to attack with claws or talons.  When he is attacked, his skin suddenly sprouts thick fur or feathers which defend against the blow.<br><br><br>

<b>Special Skills:</b><br>

Beastmasters have an inherent special skill, depending on which totem they choose:<br><br>

<b><font size="3">Bear:</b></font><br>
Beastmasters who choose this totem may make, instead of their regular attack, a Bear Hug attack against any enemy in an adjacent square.  When the Beastmaster declares that he is making this attack must roll one red die.  On a roll of 4-6 he has grabbed his enemy, otherwise the enemy slips through his grip.  The Game Master has the option of making it harder or impossible to hug smaller enemies such as Rats or Bats, or easier to hug large enemies such as Gargoyles or Minotaurs.  If the Bear Hug is successful, the Beastmaster rolls two attack dice.  While the Monster is caught in the Bear Hug, it may not attack or roll defense dice.  It may try to escape on its turn by rolling one red die.  On a roll of 1-2 it escapes, otherwise its turn is over.  Once the Beastmaster has an enemy in a Bear Hug, it may continue with this attack without rerolling until either the enemy is dead or he decides to break off the attack.  Each turn he rolls two attack dice.  While he is Bear Hugging an enemy, no other Hero may attack that Monster.  If the Beastmaster is attacked by another enemy, he rolls one fewer defense die because his attention is preoccupied with hugging.<br><br>

<b><font size="3">Wildcat:</b></font><br>
The Wildcat totem allows the Beastmaster, once each movement turn, to jump over a blocked or trapped square, even if the square contains an enemy.  The jump only counts as one square of movement.<br><br>

<b><font size="3">Hawk:</b></font><br>  
This totem gives the Beastmaster a quick and agile movement, almost as if flying.  It allows him to move, attack an enemy with some of his attack dice, move again if he has any movement squares left, and attack again.  The Beastmaster may continue moving and attacking as long as he has movement squares left and attack dice left.  If the Beastmaster has used all his attack dice, but still has movement squares left, he may use them after his last attack.  Likewise if he has finished moving, and still has attack dice, he may use them against any monsters in adjacent squares.  Note that while the Beastmaster may divvy up his attack dice, rolling some against several monsters, he may not roll past his maximum.<br><br><br>


<b>Training:</b><br>
The Beastmaster may train at the Heroes Guild as an Elf to advance his stats (see the <a href="../advance.html">Advancement Page</a> for more information).  Beastmasters do not study magic, so do not learn any spells.<br><br><br>

 <b>Skills:</b><br>
The Beastmaster may learn these skills.  Skills can be learned between quests by paying 3000 gold coins at the Heroes Guild. The Hero then rolls two red dice, and learns the skill corresponding to the number rolled. If the Hero already knows that skill he should roll again.<br><br>

A Hero can use only one skill can be used per turn. Some can last for more than one turn. If a Hero is using one of these skills, he may not use another skill until the first wears off.<br><br><br>


2.  <b><font size="3">Aspect</b></font><br>
<i>Beastmasters become more and more like their chosen totem, and you are no exception.</i><br><br>

Depending on the chosen totem, one of your basic attributes is increased.  For the Bear, the Beastmasters Attack Dice is raised by one.  For the Wildcat, his Body Points.  For the Hawk, he adds one to all his movement rolls.  The affects of this skill are cumulative - each time the Beastmaster rolls this number he may increase his attribute.<br><br><br>


3. <b><font size="3">Doomstrike</b></font><br>
<i>Summoning all your power, you slash at your opponent with extra strength.</i><br><br>

This skill allows you to roll 3 extra attack dice for any one attack.  It may only be used once per quest level.<br><br><br>


4.  <b><font size="3">Beast Magic</b></font><br>
<i>Drawing upon the intangible forces of life, you invoke the image of your totem in the form of a spell of great power.</i><br><br>

Your Warrior gains a limited spellcasting ability.  The spell he learns depends on his totem, and may be cast once per quest like normal spells.  Each time the Beastmaster rolls this number, he may learn this spell another time and cast it that many times per quest.<br><br>

Bear:  Ogre Strength - You cast this spell upon yourself, giving you the strength of an Ogre for your next attack, during which you may roll an extra three attack dice.<br><br>

Wildcat:  Speed - You cast this spell upon yourself, giving you an extra movement die for you next movement roll.  Your great speed also gives you an extra attack die and an extra defense die on your next turn.<br><br>

Hawk:  Wings Of Power - Your wings become strong, allowing you to attack your opponents twice during your next turn.<br><br><br>


5.  <b><font size="3">Evade</b></font><br>
<i>Nimbly stepping to one side, you dodge the incoming axe, flinching slightly as the razor-sharp blade whistles past your ear and buries itself in the table next to you.</i><br><br>

This skill gives you the ability to dodge incoming blows by stepping to one side.  If a monster successfully hits you, roll 1 red die.  On a roll of 1-4 you are hit as normal.  On a roll of 5-6 you evade the blow by stepping into an empty adjacent square.  if there are no squares free you must take the blow as normal.  In the process of sidestepping, you may come into contact with another monster that was not close enough to attack you originally.  This monster may not attack you until the next turn.  Similarly, by evading, you may have moved out of contact with another monster that was going to attack you.  This monster may move after you and attack on the current turn.<br><br><br>


6.  <b><font size="3">Herblore</b></font><br>
<i>You rub the foul-smelling salve into your companion's wound, reassuring him that even if the concoction does sting it is doing him good.</i><br><br>

This skill allows you to try and heal yourself or any other wounded companion.  Roll 1 red die to determine the outcome:<br><br>

<table cellpadding="10" border="5">
<tr>
<td><center>1</center></td>
<td>The patient reacts violently to the salve.<br>
Roll 3 attack dice to determine the wounds caused by the medicine.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><center>2-3</center></td>
<td>Nothing happens.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><center>4-5</center></td>
<td>The salve works.  The patient regains two Body Points.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><center>6</center></td>
<td>The treatment works better than expected.</br>
The patient regains all his lost Body Points.</td>
</tr>
</table><br>

This skill may be used once per quest level.<br><br><br>


7.  <b><font size="3">Scare</b></font><br>
<i>Your visage, part man, part beast, is so terrifying that the monsters in the room turn and run.</i><br><br>

Once per quest level, you may try to scare the monsters in the room or passage with you into running.  Roll one red die for each monster.  On a roll of 5-6 the monster turns and runs.  This will not work on animals such as wolves, bats, and rats, and will also not work on the Undead.<br><br><br>

8.  <b><font size="3">Dodge</b></font><br>
<i>Waiting until the instant, you dodge the incoming blow, sending it crashing harmlessly into the wall just inches behind you.</i><br><br>

After your defense rolls, if a Monster successfully hits you for at least one Body Point, roll one red die.  On a roll of 6, the attack misses you entirely, causing no damage.  This spell works only on hand-to-hand and missile attacks, and does not work on Spells.<br><br><br>


9.  <b><font size="3">Frenzy</b></font><br>
<i>Calling upon a primal spirit long ago suppressed by the Elven psyche, you let loose your hidden bestial nature, lashing out at your enemies with unmatched abandon.</i><br><br>

At the start of your combat phase, you may attempt to enter a state of Frenzy.  Roll one red die.  On a roll of 6, you have succeeded.  Each of the following turns, until no monsters are left in the room or passage with you, you may make two attacks.  However, while in this state you are completely oblivious to everything save a mindless blood-lust.  You care nothing for your own personal safety, and loose two defense dice during this attack.  You must attack the nearest enemy, and may not use any special items or Artifacts you may be carrying.  The only exception to this rule is if you reach 0 Body Points, at which time you may take a Healing Potion.  You must continue the Frenzy attack after this, though.  The Frenzy attack lasts until all monsters in the same room or passage as you are killed, or you die.<br><br><br>


10.  <b><font size="3">Roar</b></font><br>
<i>You emit a deep, resounding roar that reverberates off the dungeon walls, stunning your enemies with its sheer magnitude.</i><br><br>

Once per quest level you may emit an earsplitting roar (or, in the case of the Hawk, a shriek) directed at your foes that will cause all enemies in the same room or passage to miss their Attacks for the next turn.  This skill has no effect on the Undead.<br><br><br>


11.  <b><font size="3">Passage</b></font><br>
<i>A swarm of vermin closes on the Heroes, but they pause and look up at your stern gaze.  They stop, as if hearing some unspoken command, and quickly disperse into the darkness.</i><br><br>

Any animals, such as Bats, Rats, or Wolves, may fall under the Beastmasters command when he uses this skill.  For each animal roll one red die, on a roll of 6 the animal leaves and is removed from the board.<br><br><br>


12.  <b><font size="3">Hypnosis</b></font><br>
<i>Slowing your breath to half its normal rate, you slowly drift into a state of altered consciousness, calming the raging pain of your wounds and speeding their healing.</i><br><br>

Once per quest level, this skill allows you to enter a self-induced hypnotic trance and heal yourself.  You may only use this skill if there are no monsters in the same room or corridor as you.  Entering the trance takes one turn, during which you may do nothing else, including defending yourself.  Roll 1 red die to see how many Body Points you regain from the trance.  You may not go over your maximum amount of Body Points with this roll.
