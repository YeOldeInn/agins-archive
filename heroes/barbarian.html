<center><b><font size="6">THE BARBARIAN</font></b> </center><br><br><br>These 
skills were converted from the Warhammer Quest 
Rulebook<br><br><br><b>Training:</b><br>The Barbarian may advance his stats (see 
the <a 
href="../advance.html">Advancement 
Page</a> for more info). <br><br><br><b>Skills:</b><br>Barbarians can learn one 
skill between each quest. Skills cost 3000 gold coins to learn. The Barbarian 
must roll 2 red dice. The number beside each skill corresponds to the dice roll. 
If the Barbarian already knows that skill he may roll again.<br><br>Unless 
othewise noted, a Barbarian may only use one skill per turn and one skill at a 
time.<br><br><br>2. <b><font size="4">Hunter's Eye</font></b><br><i>Taking careful 
aim, you rapidly let fly a volley of arrows into the enemy ranks.</i><br><br>If 
you are using a regular bow (not a crossbow), you roll 1 red die when using this 
skill. You may fire this many arrows into your enemies.<br><br><br>3. <b><font 
size="4">Battle Blades</font></b><br><i>Your sword screams as it cuts the air in a 
blurred arc, cutting through bone and armor like butter.</i><br><br>When using 
this skill, roll a red die. On a roll of 1-3, nothing happens. On a roll of 4-6 
you gain an extra attack. This skill can only be used on the first turn when 
facing a new group of enemies.<br><br><br>4. <b><font size="4">Battle 
Rage</font></b><br><i>Consuming rage overcomes you and you go completely 
Berserk, slashing and hacking at your foe.</i><br><br>Once per quest level, you 
may use this skill to give you two attacks per turn, but you lose half your 
defense dice. Round down, but you always get at least one defense die. The 
Battle Rage lasts until no more enemies are in the same room as you or in your 
line of sight.<br><br><br>5. <b><font size="4">Run</font></b><br><i>Given the 
desperation of your situation you summon hidden reserves of energy to speed you 
on your way.</i><br><br>This skill allows you to attempt to increase your speed. 
Make your movement roll, then roll 1 red die. On a roll of 5-6 your movement 
roll is doubled.<br><br><br>6. <b><font size="4">Ignore 
Wounds</font></b><br><i>Although the pain from your Wounds is screaming along 
every nerve, you somehow manage to stay conscious and fight on.</i><br><br>This 
skill allows you to stay upright and active even when your Body Points reach 
zero. As soon as a blow takes you to zero Body Points, roll 1 red die. On a roll 
of 5-6, you gain an extra Body Point. This skill can only be used if you have no 
Potions of Healing.<br><br><br>7. <b><font size="4">Shield 
Wall</font></b><br><i>You barely manage to turn the blow as it slams towards 
you, glancing it off your shield with a flick of your wrist.</i><br><br>This 
skill allows you to catch the impact of a single blow on your shield, deflecting 
all the damage that it may have caused. If you roll no shields on a defense 
roll, you can use this skill to block all skull rolls your enemy made on the 
attack. It can only be used once per quest level, and only if you have a 
shield.<br><br><br>8. <b><font size="4">Duckback</font></b><br><i>Sensing the 
danger of your situation, you pull back from combat and find a better 
position.</i><br><br>If, after the end of your movement turn, monsters are 
placed on the board and surprise or ambush you, you may move back up to 4 
squares to a different position.<br><br><br>9. <b><font size="4">Sixth 
Sense</font></b><br><i>You sniff the air and listen intently for the telltale 
signs of the Monsters that wait to ambush you in the next room. </i><br><br>At 
the end of your movement turn, if you are directly before a closed door, you may 
use this skill to see what lies within. Roll one red die. On a roll of 5-6 all 
monsters in the room are placed on the board.<br><br><br>10. <b><font 
size="4">Reaction Strike</font></b><br><i>An Orc lurches out of the darkness 
towards you. No sooner have you caught sight of its huge bulk than your sword is 
out and ready to strike.</i><br><br>This skill allows you to make one immediate 
attack on a single Monster as soon as it is placed on the board next to you. If 
there is more than one eligible monster you may chose which one you want to 
attack. The attack is in addition to any attack you would make in normal combat. 
This skill is an instinctive reaction to being ambushed.<br><br><br>11. <b><font 
size="4">Grapple</font></b><br><i>Dropping your weapon to one side you lunge at 
your opponent and throw your arms around his chest in a bear-hug, squeezing his 
lungs and choking him.</i><br><br>This skill allows you to grapple your enemy 
rather than attack him using a weapon. This attack replaces all of your normal 
attacks. On the initial grapple, roll 1 red die. On a roll of 3-6 you have 
grabbed your opponent. Roll 2 attack dice, plus any extra dice gained from 
training in strength. The monster rolls no defense dice. On the monster's turn 
it may try to break free by rolling 1 red die. On a roll of 1 it has broken your 
grapple. If it has not broken free its turn is over. On each of your subsequent 
turns you may either break off the attack or roll your attack dice again. You 
may continue grappling with the monster, and it continues to try to break free, 
until either it is killed, it succeeds in breaking loose, or you stop the 
grapple attack.<br><br><br>12. <b><font size="4">Brute 
Strength</font></b><br><i>Flexing every muscle you possess, you slam into your 
opponent, pushing him backwards.</i><br><br>This skill allows you to attempt to 
shove an enemy out of the way. Roll 1 red die and add this number to your 
current Body Points. If this number is less than or equal to the monster's 
current Body Points, it is too big and cannot be moved. If the total is greater 
than the monster's current Body Points, it is pushed back into one of the three 
squares behind it that is unoccupied (your choice). Having pushed your foe back, 
you move into the square the monster was occupying and may now make your normal 
attack.<br><br><hr><br>
