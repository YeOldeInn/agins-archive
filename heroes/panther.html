<center><b><font size="6">KNIGHT PANTHER</center></b></font>

 <br><br><br>
Converted from 'The Knight Panther"', a Warhammer Quest Profession by T. Jordan "Greywolf" Peacock<br><br><br>

The Knights Panther is one of the oldest and most respected of the Knightly Orders of the Empire, tracing its origins back to the times of the Crusades against Araby.  Knights Panther are easily identified by the exotic furs draped about their shining armor, and the panther motif emblazoned upon their shields.<br><br>

While the Knights Panther are best known for their service in the armies of the Empire, riding barded warhorses into battle against invading armies of Chaos, they are not content to grow restful between wars.  Knights Panther often go out on solitary quests, even venturing into dark dungeons to put an end to various hideous monsters that lurk therein.<br><br>

This Warrior is one such questing Knight Panther who has seen fit to join forces with fellow Heroes.  Knights Panther are particularly upright and noble, steadfastly following the code of chivalry.  They give no quarter to the forces of evil and ask for none in return, but never fail to champion the helpless and downtrodden.<br><br>

<b>Race:</b><br>
Knights Panther are always Human<br><br><br>


<b>Weapons:</b><br>

A Knight Panther begins questing with a broadsword.  They will not use missile weapons, with the exception of thrown hand weapons.<br><br>


<b>Armor:</b><br>

A Knight Panther begins questing with no armor.<br><br>

<b>Training:</b><br>
Knights Panther may advance their stats like a Barabrian (see the <a href="../advance.html">Advancement Page</a> for more information).<br><br><br>


<b>Special Skills:</b><br>

The Knight Panther may learn these skills.  Skills can be learned between quests by paying 3000 gold coins at the Heroes Guild. The Hero then rolls two red dice, and learns the skill corresponding to the number rolled. If the Hero already knows that skill he should roll again.<br><br>

A Hero can use only one skill can be used per turn. Some can last for more than one turn. If a Hero is using one of these skills, he may not use another skill until the first wears off.<br><br><br>


2  <b><font size="5">Inspire Fear</b></font><br>
<i>As you stride into the chamber, the beady eyes of the Goblins show fear as they recognize the crest which identifies you as a Champion of the Order of Knights Panther.</i><br><br>

When the Knight Panther uses this skill, he rolls one red die.  All monsters in the same room or passage with him, except for the Undead which are immune to this skill, roll a red die.  If the Knight Panther's current Mind Points added to his die roll is greater or equal to the number rolled by the monster plus its current Mind Points, then that monster has become afraid and will try to leave the room to get away from the Knight Panther.  The Fear lasts for one turn, after which the monster may return. <br><br><br>


3  <b><font size="5">Quest</b></font><br>
<i>As you draw your sword, you recognize the foul Minotaur as the object of your chosen quest.  At all costs you must be the one to end its miserable existence.</i><br><br>

Once per quest level, as a group of monsters are placed on the board you may declare that one of them is the object of you special quest.  As long as that Monster still lives, you Warrior gets an addition attack die on all attacks made against it.  Your Knight Panther will always attack this monster first, and will not break off the attack until either it or he is dead.<br><br><br>


4 <b><font size="5"> Protect</b></font><br>
<i>Seeing that your wounded comrade would surely be killed by the incoming blow, you bravely intervene, using your body as a human shield.</i><br><br>

Your Knight Panther may take damage from an attack made by a single Monster that would have hit another Hero adjacent to him.  Your Knight Panther rolls defense dice as normal.<br><br><br>


5  <b><font size="5">Parry</b></font><br>
<i>With a practiced maneuver and a deft flick of the wrist you hook your sword around your enemy's weapon and twist it down and to one side.</i><br><br>

This skill allows you to parry an incoming blow.  When an enemy makes a successful attack against you, roll 1 red die.  On a roll of 1-4 you take the damage as normal.  On a roll of 5-6 you turn away the blow and it causes no damage.<br><br><br>


6  <b><font size="5">Disarm</b></font><br>
<i>You outfox your opponent, sending the monster's blade flying.</i><br><br>

You roll one red die.  On a roll of 5-6, instead of rolling normal attack dice, your Knight has disarmed his opponent.  The monster may not attack on its next turn, and must roll a red die to see if it is able to find its weapon.  On a roll of 1, the weapon is found.  Otherwise its attack is over.  If your Knight rolls 1-4, the disarm fails but he may still roll his normal attack dice.  A disarm attack only works on monsters holding weapons.<br><br><br>

7  <b><font size="5">Stalwart</b></font><br>
<i>As you face the hideous monster before you, you calm yourself, confident that you are prepared to meet victory or death in a heroic manner, whichever may come.</i><br><br>

Your Knight may reroll fear rolls two times.<br><br><br>


8  <b><font size="5">Delay</b></font><br>
<i>The odds are too slim, so you bravely hold off the teeming hordes while your allies beat a hasty retreat.</i><br><br>

Your Knight Panther may move to block the way so that the Monsters can not get to your allies, even if the movement takes him through squares occupied by Monsters.<br><br><br>


9  <b><font size="5">Hero of The People</b></font><br>
<i>You are recognized as a Hero, and the townfolk immediately throw an impromptu party in your honor.</i><br><br>

Your Knight Panther may use this skill between quests to make one purchase at half price (round up) from either the Armory or the Potion Shop.  <br><br><br>

10  <b><font size="5">Battle Blades</b></font><br>
<i>Your sword screams as it cuts the air in a blurred arc, cutting through bone and armor like butter.</i><br><br>

When using this skill, roll a red die.  On a roll of 1-3, nothing happens.  On a roll of 4-6 you gain an extra attack.  This skill can only be used on the first turn when facing a new group of enemies.<br><br><br>

11  <b><font size="5">Mighty Blow</b></font><br>
<i>Putting all your strength behind your blow, you bring your weapon crashing down on your opponent's body  .</i><br><br>

This skill allows you to increase the number of attack dice you roll by giving up twice that number of defense dice.  You may give up all your defense dice if wanted.<br><br><br>

12  <b><font size="5">Shield Wall</b></font><br>
<i>You barely manage to turn the blow as it slams towards you, glancing it off your shield with a flick of your wrist.</i><br><br>

This skill allows you to catch the impact of a single blow on your shield, deflecting all the damage that it may have caused.  If you roll no shields on a defense roll, you can use this skill to block all skull rolls your enemy made on the attack.  It can only be used once per quest level, and only if you have a shield.
