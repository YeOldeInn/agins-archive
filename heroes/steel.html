<center><b><font size="6">KNIGHT OF THE LEGION OF STEEL</center></b></font>

 <br><br><br>

Converted from 'Dark Knight Of The Steel Legion', a Warhammer Quest Profession by Jason Yeung<br><br><br>

The Legion Of Steel was once an honorable legion of knights, but because of greed the knights are now little better than armored thugs and mercenaries.  Many knights have lost their sense of honor, and some even serve the forces of Chaos, if the price is right.  <br><br>

Knights Of The Steel Legion are well trained, but show no quarter or mercy in battle.  The are paid to do a job, and they carry out their orders completely.  Most Knights Of The Steel Legion are warm and friendly to other Steel Legion Knights, but cold to outsiders.  They form few friendships outside the Legion, because today's friends may be tomorrow's enemies, depending on who is paying.<br><br>

Your knight has joined the group of Heroes, not to help vanquish evil from the Empire, but to gain the money that can be found in the dungeons and castles of Chaos.<br><br><br>

<b>Training:</b><br>
The Knight Of The Steel Legion may train at the Heroes Guild like a Barbarian to increase his stats (see the <a href="../advance.html">Advancement Page</a> for more information).<br><br><br>

<b>New Skills:</b><br>

The Knight Of The Steel Legion may learn these skills at the Heroes Guild for a cost of 3000 gold coins.   The Hero then rolls two red dice, and learns the skill corresponding to the number rolled. If the Hero already knows that skill he should roll again.<br><br>

A Hero can use only one skill can be used per turn. Some can last for more than one turn. If a Hero is using one of these skills, he may not use another skill until the first wears off.<br><br><br>


2  <b>Furious Charge</b><br>
<i>The Knight screams his battle cry as he charges into his opponents.</i><br><br>

Whenever a new group of monsters is placed on the board, roll one red die.  On a roll of 5-6, the Knight may attack twice on the first attack against any of these monsters.<br><br><br>


3.  <b>Seething Anger</b><br>
<i>The Knight is so angered and frustrated when he misses his opponent that he swings his weapon with renewed vigor.</i><br><br>

Whenever the Knight rolls no skulls on an attack, he may roll an extra attack dice on his next attack.<br><br><br>


4.  <b>Executioner</b><br>
<i>The Knight hits his target in a vital area, finishing him off with one blow.</i><br><br>

Whenever the Knight rolls skulls on all his dice during an attack he may double the number of hits against the opponent.<br><br><br>


5.  <b>Heart of Darkness</b><br>
<i>The Knight Of The Steel Legion is cruel warrior with a cold heart.</i><br><br>

The Knight may reroll any failed Fear roll.<br><br><br>


6.  <b>Relentless Fighter</b><br>
<i>The Knight relentlessly attacks his opponent, slowly wearing him down with strong, well placed attacks.</i><br><br>

The Knight Of The Steel Legion may use this skill on any opponent that he has fought for more than one turn.  For each consecutive turn that he uses this skill he may roll that many extra attack dice.  For instance on the first turn he may roll one extra die, on the second two extra dice, on the third three, and so on.  If the Knight kills the opponent, uses a different skill, attacks a different monster, or breaks off the attack the counter is reset back to 1 the next time he uses the skill.<br><br><br>


7.  <b>Mighty Blow</b><br>
<i>Putting all your strength behind your blow, you bring your weapon crashing down on your opponents body.</i><br><br>

This skill allows you to increase the number of attack dice that you roll by giving up twice that number of defense dice.  For every extra attack die you must give up two defense dice for that turn.  You may give up all your defense dice if wanted.<br><br><br>


8.  <b>Blood Rage</b><br>
<i>The Knight Of The Steel Legion kills one enemy and then charges into another before it has time to react.</i><br><br>

Whenever the Knight kills an enemy in hand to hand combat, he may move one square in any direction and make an additional hand to hand attack.<br><br><br>


9.  <b>Killing Blow</b><br>
<i>You judge the moment to strike perfectly and your blade slips through your opponent's armor, spearing his vital organs.</i><br><br>

This skill allows you to kill an opponent with one attack roll.  You must declare that you are using this skill before you roll your attack.  Then roll one red die.  On a roll of 6, you are successful and the enemy is killed.  On any other roll, your Killing blow fails and you should roll your normal attack dice.<br><br><br>


10.  <b>Treasure Finder</b><br>
<i>You lust for wealth serves you well as you double check the room, finding an extra cache of gold coins.</i><br><br>

Before searching for treasure, you must declare that you are going to use this skill.  It allows you to draw two treasure cards in a treasure search, not just one.  If there is a special treasure in the room, you must accept that and do not get to draw an extra card.  You must accept what is on the cards, whether treasure, trap, or monster.<br><br><br>


11.  <b>Battle Blades</b><br>
<i>Your sword screams as it cuts the air in a blurred arc, cutting through bone and armor like butter.</i><br><br>

When using this skill, roll a red die.  On a roll of 1-3, nothing happens.  On a roll of 4-6 you gain an extra attack.  This skill can only be used on the first turn when facing a new group of monsters.<br><br><br>


12.  <b>Shield Wall</b><br>
<i>You barely manage to turn the blow as it slams towards you, glancing it off your shield with a flick of your wrist.</i><br><br>

This skill allows you to catch the impact of a single blow on your shield, deflecting all the damage that it may have caused.  If you roll no shields on a defense roll, you can use this skill to block all skull rolls your enemy made on the attack.  It can only be used once per quest level, and only if you have a shield.
