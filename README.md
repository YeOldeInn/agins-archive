Archive of Agin's Inn
=====================

Before drathe ever set up Ye Olde Inn, there was Agin's Inn. Its contents have
been preserved for decades now, though they definitely show their age today.
They also have a bit of bitrot—links that don't go anywhere, email addresses
that have changed or just don't exist anymore, and resources that have been
superceded or were lost.

The site lives on as kind of the dusty old attic of Ye Olde Inn, but it'd be
great to dust some of these old things off, mark and maybe fix some broken
links, and maybe make the pages work properly on modern browsers and
resolutions. It's pretty low-priority as of this writing, but … it's here if
someone wants to contribute.
