<h2>Section 4: General Questions</h2></a>
<dl><strong>
  <dt>What is HeroQuest?
  <dd></strong><strong>HeroQuest (HQ)</strong> is a fantasy boardgame. Players
  take on the role of one of four Heroes: the Barbarian, Dwarf, Elf, or Wizard.
  Another player takes the role of Zargon/Morcar, the Game Master, who controls
  the forces of Chaos that the Heroes face in hidden stone labyrinths of
  underground rooms or corridors. Game play is simple, and allows the players to
  play as a straight board game or to incorporate Role Playing. A typical
  session, or Quest, lasts between one to two hours.<br><br><strong>
  <dt>Who designed HQ?
  <dd></strong><b>HQ</b> was originally designed by Steve Baker, who worked for
  MB UK at the time. He was also responsible for the design of MB's Space
  Crusade. Much of the artwork for the game, along with the figure sculpting,
  was done by Games Workshop<br><br><strong>
  <dt>What differences are there in the UK (1989) and the US (1991) versions of
  <b>HQ?</b>
  <dd></strong><b>HQ</b> was first released in 1989 in the UK. The initial
  release contained cards for every item that could be purchased from the
  Armory, plus each monster had only one Body Point. The Heroes' adversary was
  named Morcar. The US version released in 1991 had a cardboard box insert with
  the Armory listing, and monsters had different Body Point statistics. The
  adversary in the second release was named Zargaon. Except for the first quest,
  the quests contained in the UK and US versions were basically the
  same.<br><br>The first quest in the UK edition is <i>The Maze</i>. Each Hero
  starts in one of the corners of the board, and must find the stairs. The first
  Hero to find the stairs gains 100 gold coins. The first quest in the US
  edition is <i>The Trial</i>. The Heroes start together, and must find and
  destroy the Gargoyle Verag.<br><br><b>
  <dt>What is Advanced HeroQuest?</b>
  <dd><b>Advanced HeroQuest</b> was produced solely by Games Workshop. It is
  considerably different from its Milton Bradley counterpart. The rules are much
  more complex and detailed. The game has been out of production since 1992.
  <br><br><strong>
  <dt>Is HQ still produced?
  <dd></strong><strong>Milton Bradley</strong> is no longer producing <b>HQ</b>.
  Carl Forhan mailed them a letter in August 1994 inquiring about this, and also
  on the availability of the remaining <strong>HQ</strong> inventory. He
  received a form letter reply saying, "Thanks for your interest, but
  <strong>HQ</strong> is no longer produced." They didn't mention whether or not
  they had additional items in stock.<br><br><strong>
  <dt>How can I reach Milton Bradley?
  <dd></strong>Here's the US address for Milton Bradley:<br><br><pre>Milton Bradley Company
443 Shaker Road
East Longmeadow, MA  01028-5247
Phone: (413) 525-6411

Email: <a href="mailto:mbconsumer@hasbro.com">mbconsumer@hasbro.com</a>

Web:   <a href="http://www.hasbro.com/">http://www.hasbro.com/</a>
       (MB's parent company)
</pre><b>
  <dt>Where can I find HeroQuest?
  <dd></b>Since <b>HQ</b> and all the accompanying Quest Packs are out-of-print
  (OOP), you can only rarely find them in stores these days. Check flea markets
  and garage sales, or the Rare/OOP section in your local game store. Online,
  <b>HQ</b> can be found at online auctions like <a
  href="http://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a>, and can be found for sale on several of
  the newsgroups (go to <a href="http://www.google.com/advanced_group_search?hl=en">Google's
  Advanced Group Search</a> page to look for recent postings for <b>HQ</b>). A good idea
  when searching either an online auction or newsgroup is to look for
  '<b>heroquest</b>' (one word) and '<b>hero quest</b>' (two words) as the game
  gets posted both ways.<br><br><strong>
  <dt>What supplements (Quest Packs) were made?
  <dd></strong>There were two Quest Packs released in both the US and Europe:
  <ul>
    <li>Kellar's Keep<br>
    <li>Return of the Witch Lord</li></ul><br>Two Quest Packs were released only
  in the US:
  <ul>
    <li>Elf Quest Pack (with the quest booklet "The Mage of the Mirrors")<br>
    <li>Barbarian Quest Pack (with the quest booklet "The Frozen
    Horror")<br></li></ul><br>Three Quest Packs were released only in Europe, each
  in several languages:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Wizards of Morcar<br>
    <li>Against the Ogre Horde<br>
    <li>HeroQuest Masters Edition contained the quest <i>The Dark Company</i><br><br>
    <li>In addition the Adventure Design Kit was released in Europe. This is not
    an actual Quest Pack, but a kit to use in designing your own
  quests.<br></li></ul><br>

Three <b>HeroQuest</b> books were released in the UK.
  Two of these contained single level, solo quests:
  <ul>
    <li><i>The Tyrant's Tomb</i> by Dave Morris, contained the quest <i>A Growl
    Of Thunder</i>, a solo quest for the Barbarian.<br>
    <li><i>The Screaming Spectre</i> by Dave Morris, contained the quest
    <i>Running the Gauntlet</i>, a solo quest for the Wizard.</li></ul><br>

A HeroQuest Comic Book was released in Great Britain in 1991.  This contained articles describing the Heroes and Monsters of the game, painting your miniatures, a Quest called <i>Revenge of the Weatherman</i>, a comic strip adventure, HeroQuest merchandise, and some new tiles.<br><br>

<b>
  <dt>What order should the quests be played in?</b>
  <dd></b>The quest packs themselves contain hints as to the order of some of
  the quests should be played in. After the basic quest book, there is a page
  detailing how the Emperor was trapped in Karak Varn (Kellar's Keep). In
  Against the Ogre Horde, Morcar (Zargon) laments his failures in Kellar's Keep
  and with his ally the Witch Lord. In the same quest pack he sends out his
  Chaos Warlock Festral, who returns home in Wizard's of Morcar in failure.
  Using these clues these quest packs should be played in this order:<br>
  <ul>1) Basic Game Quests<br>2) Kellar's Keep<br>3) Return of the Witch
    Lord<br>4) Against the Ogre Horde<br>5) Wizard's of Morcar</ul>There are no
  other clues as to where The Frozen Horror, Mage of the Mirrors, or Back
  Company fit into the list. I would suggest playing them after the first 5
  quests. Any other ideas? <br><br><strong><a name="sources">
  <dt>What other sources of HQ supplements are available?
  <dd></a></strong>Two quests were published in White Dwarf Magazine, published
  by Games Workshop.

  <p>Note that all of these games are out of print. <br><br><strong></p>
  <dt>Do you have any suggestions for improving HQ?
  <dd></strong>Here are a few:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Add some non-combat encounters. These could be anything from a dying
    Goblin with an important message, to a Dwarf who's digging for gold in a
    remote passage. Non-combat encounters make the players think more about
    what's going on in their surroundings. Sometimes the encounters have
    important implications, others may be to confuse or entertain the players.
    <p></p>
    <li>You can design Quests around a plots or themes. What if there's a feud
    going on between the Orcs and the Goblins? Will they attack the Heroes, or
    try to enlist their help? How about a mystic portal that must be closed to
    stop the outpouring of Undead? These longer-running plots can create ongoing
    goals for the Heroes to pursue.
    <p></p>
    <li>And who can resist the Recurring Villain? Create a villainous Wizard,
    Chaos Warrior, etc., complete with some special items or abilities, and have
    him do his best to foil the Heroes' Quests. You don't have to use him in
    every adventure, and sometimes he may not even be the primary antagonist,
    but a properly played Recurring Villain can be a nuisance and a challenge
    rolled up into one. Make sure he has a way to retreat, however, such as the
    Escape spell. You don't want your Heroes defeating him on the first
    encounter!

<h2>Section 5: Specific Rule Questions</h2></a><br>If you have any questions you
would like to submit, please forward them to me at <a
href="mailto:innkeep@aginsinn.com">innkeep@aginsinn.com</a>
<h3><strong>HeroQuest</strong> game system</h3>
<dl><strong>
  <dt>SPELL CANCELLATION
  <dd></strong><strong>How does one handle multiple (and possibly conflicting)
  spells cast on the same character? For instance Zargon casts Fear (reduce to 1
  attack die) on the Elf who's normal roll is 2 attack dice. The Elf then casts
  Courage (+2 attack dice) on himself. How many attack dice does the Elf
  roll?</strong><br><br>The spell effects should be applied in the order they
  occur. So in the above example, the Elf would have 3 attack dice. No matter
  what weapon he is using, he is reduced to 1 attack die because of the Fear.
  The Courage spell then adds 2 attack dice to this number. If the Courage spell
  is broken (either by losing sight of a monster or by using the 1 attack that
  it is good for) then Fear is the only spell in effect and the Elf is reduced
  to 1 die. If the Fear is broken first, the Elf can roll 4 attack dice (2 + 2
  for Courage). <br><br><strong>
  <dt>JUMPING PITS AND DIAGONAL MOVEMENT
  <dd></strong><strong>In the basic rules, it pretty clearly states that
  diagonal movement is not allowed. However, under the section that describes
  how to jump a pit a diagram shows that a jump to a diagonal square is allowed.
  (See diagram.) What's the deal here? </strong><pre>         _______
        |   |\ /|
        |   | X | &lt;-- Pit
        |___|/_\|
            |   |
            |   |
            |___|
</pre>In the basic rules, a pit may be jumped if the Hero has 2 movement
  squares left. He moves into any of the Adjacent squares beyond the pit (see
  the rulebook section <strong>JUMPING A TRAP</strong>). In this instance, the
  only adjacent square is diagonal, so it is the only pit that the Hero may land
  on.<br><br><b>
  <dt>UNARMED COMBAT
  <dd></b><b>What happens if a Hero's weapon is destroyed with the Rust Spell?
  How do they fight?</b><br><br>In HeroQuest, the Heroes roll attack dice
  depending on the weapon they are using. The rules make no mention of fighting
  without weapons, yet the possiblity does exist. In the Quest #6, "Legacy of
  the Orc Warlord", it states that an unarmed Hero rolls 1 attack die. Since
  this is the same as a Hero armed with a dagger, I let the Heroes roll "Unarmed
  Combat Dice" to attack unarmed. The Hero must roll a Black Shield to hit. They
  may roll this many dice: <br>

    <dt>JUMPING LONG PITS WITH RABBIT BOOTS

    they then not fail a long pit jump on a white shield, or even a
    skull?</strong><br><br>No, Rabbit Boots (an artifact gained in the Return of
    the Witch Lord) behave the same regardless of the size of the pit.
    <br><br><strong>
    <dt>JUMPING LONG PITS WITH A POTION OF DEXTERITY

    <strong>guarantee a long pit jump?</strong> <br><br>Yes. <br><br></dd></dl>
  <hr>

  <h3>Barbarian Quest Pack</h3>
  <dl><strong>
    <dt>YETIS AND DEFENDING
    <dd></strong><strong>Can Yeti roll defend dice while hugging? (They can't
    make other attacks while hugging, but can they
    defend?)</strong><br><br>Every Hero or Monster should get to roll defend
    dice, regardless of the circumstances. However, one could develop a house
    rule whereby the defend dice of a Yeti is reduced while hugging by one or
    two dice. This is strictly optional, of course. <br><br><strong>
    <dt>ICE GREMLIN STEALING AND MOVING
    <dd></strong><strong>If an Ice Gremlin moves first, then steals something,
    does he still get to run?</strong><br><br>One could argue stealing is an
    action, and as such terminates the movement phase. However, many things
    don't count as an action, only those things specifically listed on the Hero
    cards and rulebook. You could allow the Gremlin to use his remaining
    movement points in the escape.<br><br><strong>
    <dt>LONE HERO AGAINST YETI
    <dd></strong><strong>If a lone Hero encounters a Yeti which successfully
    "hugs" him, is the Hero automatically dead? It would seem so; the rules
    didn't seem to allow for a hero to free himself from the Yeti's
    grip.</strong><br><br>As the rules indicate, a "hugged" Hero may not defend
    nor take any actions. This is probably intended to allow a deadly Monster in
    the game, which will cause the egomaniacs of the group to think twice before
    wildly attacking. :) One suggestion would be to allow the Hero to roll
    his/her normal attack dice at the start of each turn. If less than two
    skulls are rolled, the Hero remains in the hug. If two or more skulls are
    rolled, no damage is inflicted on the Yeti, but the hug is broken and the
    Hero may move away if desired (the Hero's action is lost for the turn,
    however). <br><br></dd></dl>
