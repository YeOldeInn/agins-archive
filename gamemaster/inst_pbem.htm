<h1 align="center">Instructions: PBEM</h1>
<p>As of version 2.5 you can load/save games in progress. This opens up for
interrupting your game sessions or even more significant, allows you to
Play-By-eMail.</p>
<p>On this page you'll find some suggestions for PBEM.</p>
<p>You could play in different styles depending on preference - With AI ON or
OFF, with or without a dedicated human Gamemaster and with/without computer
drawn treasure cards.</p>
<p>Either way you will probably want to supplement the saved game by notes in
the email telling the others of your dice rolls, actions and current status.</p>
<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">AI<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p>With <b>AI on</b> you won't be able to save in the middle of Zargons turn. So
when the last player has processed his steps, the monsters will act. Due to the
random nature of their attacks you cannot recreate Zargons actions by loading
the game again. You must therefore decide who will view and monster attacks and
inform the other players of the events. </p>
<p>With <b>AI off </b>you can save during Zargons turn but will have to agree on
how monsters behave and who will move the monsters around.</p>
<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">Dedicated human gamemaster<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p>With a &quot;real&quot; gamemaster you can play as you're accustomed to with
that person being the &quot;god&quot; deciding on all monster events and passing
out rulings. He may even decide to beef up the game during play by adding more
monsters or such.</p>
<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">Treasure cards<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p>These can be computer drawn or manually drawn. The other players won't be
able to verify what card has been drawn by the computer, but that goes for
manually drawn cards too. You could decide that a human gamemaster draws all
cards.</p>
<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">Sample turn<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p>Heres a sample of a PBEM turn with the 4 original characters and Zargons turn
included.</p>
<p>Player1: Barbarian opens a door and discovers 2 Orcs. He charges the nearest
and kills it. <br>
(save, next player)</p>
<p>Player2: The Elf tries to come to the Barbarians aid but only rolls 4 and
cannot reach the room.<br>
(save, next player)</p>
<p>Player 3: The Dwarf attacks the remaining Orc but fails in his attack.<br>
(save, next player)</p>
<p>Player 4: The Wizard is still in another room and uses the time to search for
treasure. He draws a Wandering monster card. He uses the &quot;add wandering
monster&quot; from the rightclick menu and is attacked immediately by a Fimir,
but defends the attack.<br>
(save, Zargons turn)</p>
<p>The human gamemaster watches as the fimir attacks the Wizard again with 2
skulls and the Dwarf is attacked by the Orc with 1 skull. He mails the players
telling them this, but since neither attacked player could die from these
attacks he lets player1 know he can continue with his turn immediately. The
dwarf and Wizard simple inform the others of their defense rolls, current BP
etc.</p>
