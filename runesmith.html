<center><b><font size="6">DWARF RUNESMITH</font></b></center><br><br><br>



A Dwarf may make a visit to the Runesmith to engrave a single Rune on an item of equipment in between quests. The Dwarf using the item with the Rune can decide when and where he wants to use it.  Only one rune may be engraved between each quest.<br><br>

There are two different levels of runes - Normal Runes and Master Runes.  Normal Runes cost 1000 Gold Coins.  Master Runes cost 3000. There are two categories of Runes which may be engraved. Weapon Runes may be inscribed onto any traditional Dwarf Weapon that the Dwarf has.  Traditional Dwarf Weapons are Axes and Hammers.  While a Dwarf can use other weapons, these are the only weapons that a Runesmith will inscribe runes onto.  Armor Runes may be inscribed onto any armor, shield or helmet. <br><br>

A Dwarf may only ever have one Master Rune engraved onto any of his items at a time, but may have any number of Normal Runes.  The effects of some runes are cumulative - a Dwarf may have more than one of these inscribed on his items.<br><br>

If the Dwarf ever loses or is no longer wearing or wielding the item inscribed with the rune, he loses the effects of the rune.  When the Dwarf begins wearing or wielding the item again, the effects of the rune returns.<br><br><hr><br>

Master Weapon Runes can only be used once, and then they disappear.  Roll 1 red die to determine the Master Rune engraved on the weapon.<br><br>
