The Elf, or any other dexterous Hero,  may use two single handed weapons; one in each hand.  One single handed weapon may be used normally in the 'on' hand (the player can decide if the Hero is right or left handed).  In the 'off' hand the player may hold a hatchet, shortsword, or dagger.  When used for defense the 'off' hand weapon adds 1 defense die.  When used to attack the Hero can roll attack dice for both weapons.  The 'off' hand weapon cannot be used to attack and defend on both turns.  The Hero must decide before attacking what the 'off' hand weapon will be used for - either defense or attacking.<br><br><hr><br>

Hi. I was just reading your "alternate rules" section, saw the one about using
two weapons, and thought you might like to know what me and my friends have
done.<br><br>

We decided that the three combat-oriented characters (Barbarian, Dwarf, Elf)
could normally hold a weapon in one hand, and a shield in the other. If a
player wants to use a second weapon instead of the shield, he can, but he gets
a 1-die penalty when he attacks with that weapon. <br><br>

We then devised a new character type called the "Swordsman". He begins with 6
Body and 4 Mind points, and no spells. The Swordsman is able to carry two
weapons and attack with either, with no penalty to either. He also has the
ability to attack twice per turn, but each attack must be made with a
different weapon, and he isn't allowed to move on that turn. <br><br>

This character fits quite well into every campaign we have played, so we
thought we'd share it. We've also invented a couple other character types, but
those are subjects for another letter. Thanks for your time! <br><br>
