<center><font size="5"><b>Move News</b></font></center><br><br><br>

After three years of being on the free webservers, we've finally purchased our own space.  It's been a rough three years.  We outgrew <b>Geocities</b> in just a few months.  First we moved to <b>Xoom</b>.  This was fine for almost two years; then <b>NBCI</b> bought out <b>Xoom</b>, and started putting bandwidth restrictions on their sites.  Because of the size and popularity of the site downloads, especially the tiles, we were pegged as a <i>warez</i> site and closed down (twice).  So we moved to <b>Fortunecity</b>, <b>Topcities</b>, and finally <b>9ug</b>.  All of which decided to switch their service after we moved their.  In the case of <b>Topcities</b> we didn't even get a chance to finish uploading the files before they changed.<br><br>

Finally I got tired of the constant moving, and begun looking for a permanent site to move the webpage.  Along with the move I purchased a domain name (Ron suggested the name AginsInn.com) so that if there is ever the need to move again I can keep the same address.<br><br>

So what does this mean to you (besides reading a long winded sob-story)?  Hopefully the biggest change will be faster access times for page loads and downloads.  The free webservers were often VERY slow.  Also once all the moving is finished I can begin regular updates again.<br><br>

We ask you to please be patient during the move.  I am going to update this page as I complete the moving of main pages (the buttons off the homepage).  Please do not send any emails telling me that a link is broken if it does not appear below.  The link is broken because I haven't moved it yet! :-)  If you find a broken link in any of the pages below, please email me and let me know.<br><br>
