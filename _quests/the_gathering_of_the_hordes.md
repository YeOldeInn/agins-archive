  commander of the Forgotten Legion, escaped with many of the Witch Lord's
  powerful spell books. This, and the loss of so many troops during their
  entrapment within Karak Varn was the beginning of a downward spiral for the

  Emperor and his subjects; and a decade has since past, the Empire continuing
  to fall into even darker times. Now with the forces of Chaos closing in on the
  Empire's borders, a dwindling army, barren crops, and starving citizens, there
  is one final hope: The four brave Heroes who had aided the Empire so many
  times in years past must now be recalled...
