  With the crippling blow dealt to the heart of the Black Orc's Keep, and the
  capturing of the five Tomes of Chaos Magic, the Empire seemed ripe for an
  age of prosperity. Indeed even our Heroes were to take part, given their own
  lands and titles following their victory.

  Lord Castanea, the Imperial Seer who had aided in the onslaught against the
  Hordes, has gone missing after researching the inner workings of the Tomes
  of Chaos Magic. The Emperor's Elite guard were sent to collect Lord
  Castanea. Upon their return, not only were they empty-handed, but they
  slaughtered the members of the Imperial Court while seemingly under the
  control of Lord Castanea. Now Lord Castanea has begun to gather the remnants
  of the forces of Chaos to him, and fled beyond the borders of the
  Empire.

  The Emperor has sent out Scouts to the corners of the Empire to track down
  its Heroes. But this time it may not be enough, without the members of the
  Court the Empire is itself in chaos and disarray; and at a tactical
  disadvantage. New blood must be found to help govern the Empire!
