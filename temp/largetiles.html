src="/WorkingStiff/Thumbs/Garden.jpg" width="390" height="255"><h2>The Palace Garden</h2>

<b>The real politics of the Empire are not determined in the throne room or in parliament, <br>
but in the renown Palace garden. Strolling along the manicured trees and perfumed flowers, <br>
with conversation masked by the running water of the fountains, kings, prime ministers, and<br>
and diplomats negotate treaties that will decide the course of many kingdoms.<br><br>

The garden has also been the scene of the occasional assassination of royal and elected officials.<br>
It has also served as a discreet meeting place for secret lovers. Here's an opportunity to have your characters<br>
use thier charisma and social skills instead of swordplay and spells!<br>
A refreshing change of location for your party of adventurers<br> who are weary of
one too many trips into slimy dungeons and dusty catacombs!<br><br>



<CENTER><IMG alt="Dimension One" src="/WorkingStiff/Thumbs/dim1.jpg" width="436" height="282"><h2>Dimension One</h2>There are 
countless alternative dimensions that exist in the magical cosmic plane.<BR>Is 
this one a prison of some wizard, held captive for several millennia?<BR>Does that 
endless running stream of water hold any healing properties?<BR>Perhaps it is an 
illusion to disorient a group of adventurers?<BR><BR>


</i><CENTER><IMG alt="Blue Stone Temple" src="/WorkingStiff/Thumbs/templepix.gif" width="479" height="310"><h2>Blue Stone Temple</h2>
Built by a forgotten civilization, this temple laid hidden for many centuries.<br>
What's the secret of it's huge blue polished stone?<br>
And who (or what!) has been keeping the temple maintained <br>
and cleared from the vegetation of the encroaching forest?<br>
<br>
