<strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><h2>Designing RPG Tiles</h2></font></strong>
      <div align="justify">
        <!pre>
        <p><b> A little background history...</b> I've always admired the graphic
          components of the many RPG and wargames I have bought over the years.
          In fact, I'm usually sold on the graphic presentation of a game rather
          than the game system itself. I find the visual display of painted miniatures
          on colorful mapsheets and game boards the coolest part of the gaming
          experience. When I bought a copy of the Milton Bradley game HeroQuest,
          and later Space Crusade, in 1998, I would not play either of them until
          I had all the miniatures painted! In September of the that same year
          I came across Dewayne Agin's HeroQuest website. On his site was a page
          devoted to downloadable game tiles for HeroQuest. Seeing this page sparked
          the desire to try my hand at making game board tiles. My first several
          tiles were terrible, and thankfully have been forever digitally deleted.
          In the next two and a half years, I would master the art of making tiles
          and eventually contribute over 100 full color game tiles to Dewayne's
          site. Dewayne was very supportative in zipping the files and making
          new pages for the thumbnails for me to be posted. Many times I would
          send him a second or third version of a tile to replace the previous
          one that had minor errors. He would cheerfully upload it to keep my
          sensitive artist ego happy. In 1999, at the suggestion of a visiting
          gamer, I decided to try to market my tiles by offering a printing service
          for my tiles. Encouraged by the response, I created my own business,
          Working Stiff Productions. Feeling confined with theI the standard 8"
          x 10" size format, I began making custom-sized 11" x 17" game tiles.
          My next big break came when in October of 2000, The Art Director of
          Dragon Magazine, Peter Whitley, reviewed a porfolio I had sent and contracted
          me to do a series of five full color tile posters for five issues in
          the Dragon. Four of the posters tiles have been published in the issues
          280-283. The last poster was to my knowledge never published. Perhaps
          it may yet appear in some future issue of the Dragon. Working for Dragon
          magazine helped me set higher standards for my tiles. Peter Whitley
          was very kind and helpful getting my work to fir a published format.
        </p>
        <p>In the 2003 August issue of PC Gamer Richard Caravan and I received
          high marks (88%) for our artwork on Mark H. Walker's Lock 'N Load Vietnam
          Board game. Richard designed the suberb counters, and I design the five
          full color maps. It was a great honor to hear the National Vietnam Veteran's
          Art museum had inducted the game into it's art collection.</p>
        <p><b>What program do you use?</b> Adobe Photoshop 6.0 is my program of
          choice. I can’t speak on the merits of other image paint programs like
          Corel Draw or Canvas, but Photoshop has everything a 2D digital artist
          could ask for. Layers, special effects filters, dozens of art tools,
          and color adjusting features. I also use a plug in program called Alien
          Skin to create extra texture effects such as bevels, glows, wood textures,
          glass, fire, and many others. Photoshop is a ravenous pig for tapping
          the computer's resources. It can take all the RAM, hard drive space,
          and CPU speed you can give it, and still ask for more! Not that it freezes
          or crashes-- it is a very stable program. But when you are working on
          an 11” x 17” tile at 250 DPI,it will slow to crawl when applying a filter
          effect or performing a simple cut and paste. Graphic images that physically
          large, at such high resolution, really tax a computer. When I first
          designed tiles for Dewayne's site, I set them in 72 dpi resolution for
          easy file downloading. I slowly increased the resolution up to 100,
          to 125, to presently 250 dpi. The higher dpi gives beautifully detailed
          images, but at the cost of humogously large file sizes. You may want
          to set your DPI resolution down to 100 to 150 DPI to keep the file size
          down and make the tile file less demanding for the computer to work
          with. Your printed piece will not be as sharp as compared to a 250 DPI
          one, but still look prety good for gaming. I guess that’s why some computer
          magazines use Photoshop as a benchmark when testing new computers for
          performance. Recently I've been experimenting with 3D rendering. The
          results have been very exciting! I can create many objects for tiles
          quickly and accurately and import them as 2D images in Photoshop. More
          of my tiles in the future will be using items designed in 3D. </p>
        <p><b>How long does it take? </b> Depending on the complexity of the tile,
          whether it’s just a dungeon floor or a very decorated room, anywhere
          from 1-5 hours for an 8”x 10” size tile. High-tech tiles take more time
          as they required lots of nuts, bolts, buttons, etc. Larger (11” x 17”)
          tiles are ten times longer to make.It took 40 plus hours to create the
          Space Freighter tile set, “Brandy’s Lament”. I was pretty burned out
          after making that one. It was several weeks before I would even consider
          making another tile! </p>
        <p><b>How do you achieve such realistic effects?</b> Using a combination
          of design techniques and clip art photos I can achieve a near photo-realistic
          effect with many of my tiles. Clip art saves me considerable time from
          having to design sub-components for many tiles. But using clip art effectively
          is more than just cut and paste---much of the clip art I use has to
          be resized, cropped, trimmed, flipped, rotated, distorted, and otherwise
          modified to fit the scale and colors of a tile. I spend a lot of time
          researching hundreds of clip art files to find one to suit my purpose.
          But while I make use of stock photo clip art, the majority of my tiles
          are created <i>ex nilio</i> in Photoshop. The real key in making realistic
          tiles is the use of lighting. Highlights and shadows give depth and
          drama to artwork. Using Photoshop’s layers, blur filters, dodge and
          burn tools I can create lighting effects to make the tile more dramatic.
          Adding texture overlays also enhances the finished product. These texture
          overlays can be imported and blended in at different levels of transparency
          to really set off a stone floor and other tile elements. Keeping the
          tiles to 25mm scale can be tricky--I keep a 25mm miniature next to my
          computer compare against the tile on the monitor to help keep the tiles
          in reasonably close to scale. Even so, I often fudge with the scale
          to make items on the tiles bigger than life for dramatic effect--- I
          used the excuse of artistic license more than once to justify my errors
          in keeping scale! </p>
        <p><b>Where do you get your ideas for tiles?</b> Mostly movies & comics.
          Among my favorite artists are N.C. Wyeth, M.C. Escher, The Brothers
          Hilderbrandt, and Jack "King" Kirby. A lot of the old adventure movies
          from the 1960's give me inspiration for themes to make tiles. The idea
          for the "Crocodile pit" tile was from an old Tarzan movie I saw as a
          kid. Nowadays when I watch a movie I spend more time watching the scenery
          and the sets than the actors! Sometimes I get ideas from studying photos
          of historical buildings and structures from the past.The tricky part
          is making the idea translate into a top-down perspective on a tile.
          I often approach the design of a tile as if I am building a stage for
          the action to take place. I often add obstacles, pathways, different
          elevations, and other features to make a tile unique, and to give challedges
          for a party of adventurers to overcome. My goal is always to make a
          tile evoke mystery or drama. I like to think that my tiles often tell
          a story by themselves, giving the GM ideas for running an adventure.
        </p>
        <p><b>A final bit of advice:</b> Don't be too discourage if your first
          attempts don't come out very well the first time. (Then again, you may
          be a natural born artist and whip out masterpieces on the first try--I've
          seen it happen!) If you saw my first tiles I did three years ago, you
          would have thought they were pretty pathetic. It wasn't till my second
          year I started to turn out some decent ones, and by the third year I
          was finally good enough to get Dragon Magazine's attention to publish
          my work. Even then, it wasn't until my last two tiles in the poster
          series that I begin to hit my stride. You must decide if you are going
          for masterpieces, or just some nice, useful tiles for gaming-- It can
          be a toss up to decide which would you rather do ----gaming or making
          tiles! Live with your choice and don't compare your work with others
          unless you are going for masterpieces. I make tiles because I enjoy
          it, (or getting decent bucks to do it!) The minute making a tile seems
          like work is when I wrap it up and call it a night. It's gotta be fun
          to be worth doing. </p>
