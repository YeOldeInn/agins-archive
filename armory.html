<center><b><font size="6">RULES FOR THE ARMORY</font></center></b><br><br>

<center><b>Here are some new rules for the armoury for you to use as needed.</b></center><br><br>

<img src="art/whiteball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt="Whiteball">The Armory will buy back weapons at 1/2 their cost (round down).  The Armory will buy back weapons taken from all monsters except the Undead.<br><br>

<img src="art/whiteball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt="Whiteball">Heroes can carry only a limited number of weapons at a time (this includes bows).  I set this number at three, you may want to raise or lower this number.  You also may want to 'fudge' on this number some - a Hero could carry more daggers but fewer halberds.<br><br>

<img src="art/whiteball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt="Whiteball">Heroes may take weapons from monsters they have killed, except for the Undead, to sell or use.  A Hero must tell the Game Master when he wishes to take a weapon, then note it on his chart.  The Hero that kills the monster gets first choice on the weapon the monster was carrying, then any other Hero in the room can take it on his turn.  The weapon is gone if all the Heroes leave the room or hallway.<br><br>

<img src="art/whiteball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt="Whiteball">If a Hero's weapon is destroyed in battle, he can either take one from a dead monster or use one he is carrying.<br><br>

<img src="art/whiteball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt="Whiteball">Switching weapons, including going from a bow to a melee weapon,  takes 1 turn.  During this turn the Hero may not attack.<br><br>

<img src="art/whiteball.gif" width="14" height="14" alt="Whiteball">Below is a list of the weapons carried by monsters:<br><br>

<ul><b>Goblins</b> carry daggers and hatchets.<br>
<b>Orcs</b> carry several types of swords which I included with the shortswords, flails, and cleavers which I included with the axes.<br>
<b>Fimirs</b> have axes.<br>
<b>Chaos Warriors</b> have battle axes.<br>
<b>Chaos Mages/Sorcerers/Warlocks</b> have daggers.<br>
<b>Gargoyles</b> have broadswords.  Alternately you may wish to give a Gargoyle a broadsword and a whip.</ul><br><br><br>

Note:  After a Hero throws a 'recoverable' weapon, the Game Master needs to tell him which square it landed in.  If the Hero rolled at least one skull, the weapon is in the same square as the monster.  It can only be recovered after the monster is killed.  If the Hero did not roll any skulls, the weapon flew in a straight line from the Hero to the Monster to the nearest wall.  The Game Master should decide which square this is and tell the Hero that the weapon landed in it.  The Hero must physically move to the square his weapon landed in to recover it.  Here are some <a href="quests/weapons.zip">tiles </a>(9k) that you can download to place on the board to represent thrown weapons.<br><br>
