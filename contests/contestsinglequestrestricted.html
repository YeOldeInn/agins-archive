<center><b><font size="6">SINGLE LEVEL QUEST CONTEST<br>RESTRICED TO ITEMS IN
ORIGINAL GAME</font></b></center><br><br><br>The June contest will be to create
a new single level quest. You are restricted to only the items found in the
original game.<br><br>Entries should be emailed to me at <a
href="mailto:dagin@my-deja.com">dagin@my-deja.com</a> or <a
href="mailto:arkcaver@yahoo.com">arkcaver@yahoo.com</a>. If the mailbox gets
full please drop me a note on the message board and I will fix the problem. If
you cannot email a graphic quest to me and want to send a copy by postal mail,
please email me first to make arrangements.<br><br>If you wish to be a judge in
the contest, please contact me at one of the addresses above. A judge cannot
submit an entry for this contest. You will be judging for this contest only. You
can judge other contests, I just want all judges to sign up for each contest.
This will allow someone to judge one contest and then enter another.<br><br>

<ol>
  <li>Entries must be submitted by 8:00 a.m. Central Time (US) on November 1,
  2001. Entries received after this time will not be considered.
  <li>Entries using any item not included with the basic HeroQuest game will
  automatically be disqualified (although they can be submitted for the August
  contest). Items in the basic HQ game were: spell cards, monster figures,
  tiles, and furniture. Quests may have special rules, new monsters, new traps,
  etc., as long as they only use the items that came in the basic game. The 14
  quests that came with the basic game are all good examples of this type of
  quest.
  <li>If the quest calls for the Heroes to be a specific level (i.e. they should
  be experienced, they should have some artifacts, etc.), then this should be
  noted on the quest. Unless it is noted it will be assumed that these are
  general quests for all players.
  <li>This quest should not be designed for use with the men-at-arms or
  mercenaries that came with some quest packs, as these were not included in the
  basic game.
  <li>Entries may be submitted in any form, using any type of icon to represent
  the items in the quest. Scanned images of a paper quest is acceptable, as is a
  "text only" quest (text used to draw the map). I reserve the right to convert
  any scanned or text quest to the icons used on this website.
  <li>All entries must be original, and not have been posted or published
  elsewhere previous to the contest.
  <li>All entries will be posted to the website, on both this page and on the <a
  href="../quests.html">New Quests</a> page.
</li></ol><b><u>JUDGING</b></u><br>Entries will be judged on the following
criteria:
<ul>
  <li>Originality - 45%
  <li>Enjoyment - 35%
  <li>Technical - 20%</li></ul><b>Originality</b> is just what it says - have you
come up with a new idea for your quest. Is it special in some way? Is it
different from other quests?<br><br><b>Enjoyment</b> is the "fun factor". Was it
fun to play? Was it too easy? Too hard?<br><br><b>Technical</b> is graded on
things like spelling, grammer, ease of understanding, whether the quest is
consise, and so on. <br><br><b><u>Prize</b></u><br>The prize for this contest
has not been determined yet. Please check back for more info.<br><br><font
