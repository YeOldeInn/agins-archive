....this is sheer rock´n´roll on card board!

<p><font color="blue"> Ron,<br> These are absolutely stunning. I am an instant fan of 
  your work. Have you ever thought about having them commercially reproduced and 
  distributed?…… ……I printed out a couple of your tiles on a color laser printer 
  this morning, and now that I see them printed, I am even more impressed with 
  your work. <br>
  Thanks, <br>Anthony Roberson Editor <br>Role-Play News<br>

  </font color> Hallo Ron,<br> my name Wolfgang, I'm from Germany and I have to tell 
  you that in the 20 years I'm playing Role Playing Games I have never come across 
  floorplanes as beautiful as yours. Like with many other people my interest in 
  Fantasy role-playing was rekindled by the release of Dungeons &amp; Dragons 
  3rd edition and in my current campaign your floorplanes play a vital part. It 
  seems like each one of them tells a little story and often I just create the 
  adventure around it. Using your water tiles last week really got everyone into 
  a holiday mood…... …….Finally let me tell you, that I'm not the only one in 
  Germany who thinks your work is great, I have heard that now from quite a number 
  of Game Masters. Thank You very much. <br>Yours, <br>Wolfgang Hubner<br> Bremerhaven, Germany</p>
    <p><font color="blue">Hello Ron,<br>
      </font color> <font color="blue"> I received the package yesterday. Now, I 
      was pretty impressed with some of the tiles I was able to print with my 
      little HP printer, but those laser printed ones...INCREDIBLE! .....<br>

      </font color> Hi there.<br>
      I just wanted to say that your tiles are beautiful! I'll probably use some 
      of the more generic ones (road, bridge, forest, etc.) for my upcoming D&amp;D 
      campaign. <br>
      Thanks! <br>

      <font color="blue"> Ron, <br>
      I was checking out your page, and your floor tiles are so awesome. You've 
      put a lot of beautiful color and detail into them and I just can't resist. 
      I would like to go ahead and order your Smithworks of Khaldzudun tile and 
      also a set of Indoor Tiles…. <br>

      </font color> Dear Mr. Shirtz, <br>
      My name is Kari Ranta-Ojala and I have been playing and designing quests 
      for about 10 years now. …I love your tiles. They bring lots of extra variability 
      to the game. ……Thanks for your time and effort into making Heroquest a more 
      enjoyable experience. <br>
      Thanks, <br>
      Kari<br>
      <br>
      <font color="blue"> Dear Ron,<br>
      The tiles look great, especially the Smithworks, congratulations on your 
      artistic skill. I'll look out for some other tiles as you produce them. 
      Nice dealing with you, and thanks again. <br>
      Best wishes, <br>

    <p>...I don't know if any of the other old-timers on the board experienced 
      this while looking at these things, but I felt a wave of nostalgia when 
      I saw them. They elicit a sense of &quot;gee whiz&quot; awe and wonder at 
      the sheer imagination involved - from the &quot;Broken Gods&quot; tiles 
      to the throne rooms, these things reminded me of how I felt when I first 
      started playing. Look at the &quot;Room of Wonders&quot; or the one with 
      the huge monstrous eye looking up through the grating or the desrt island 
      or the pharaoh's tomb or...well, you get the idea. 
	  <br>Thanks,
	  <br>Dragoth.

      Ron, <br>
      … I think the quality of the prints look better than most ink jets. <br>

      First I just wanted to say thanks for putting those great board sections 
      on the net for download they're great! …..Thank you for your time. <br>

      Mr. Shirtz,<br>
      …….. I've been collecting your tiles from Dewayne Agin's web page and think 
      they are magnificent. Keep up the great work. …. <br>

      Thank you. I got the tiles today and they're great! Thank you so much! And 
      thank you for taking the time to do it for me. I appreciate everything you've 
      done to make HQ more fun! <br>
      Thanks, <br>

      <font color="blue"> Ron, <br>
      I received the tiles yesterday! Outstanding. They're even better on actual 
      printed paper than they appeared on the website. I look forward to doing 
      future business with you. <br>
      Thanks again!<br>
