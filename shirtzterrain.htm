  Temple comes from the old Mattel Fantasy board game, Dark World. Extra bits 
  were added to the Temple posts using various GW bitz. The Temple was glued to 
  a hardboard base, with pieces of blue insulation board broken up and attached 
  to simulate boulders. Watered down glue was brushed on and three types of model 
  terrain dirt and stone were sprinkled throughout. Everything then was primed 
  black, then progressively drybrushed with Shadow gray, Codex grey, Reaper Stone 
  grey, Bleached bone, and a final, careful drybrushing of white. The temple was 
  given a wash of Rustal to give it a motte pattern and to &quot;warm up&quot; 
  the otherwise cold grey colors. Deer moss/lichen was superglue in various cracks 
  in the rocks.</font></p>

  ramp for 40K gaming. The ramp was made from a needlepoint plastic canvas template. 
  The Chaos Marines are from the old Space Crusade game</font></p>
